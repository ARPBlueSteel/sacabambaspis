- Oct 1934, PLA set-off on 9000 km or 6000 mile trek to northern province of Shensi
- Communists = 100,000
- Trek = starvation, fighting the KMT
- Oct. 1935 = reached Yenan but lost 3/4 of men

> Chiang unable to defeat Mao

# Foreign Altercations: Japan & WWII 1937-1945

- July 1937 - Japan invades rest of China
- **United Front** = KMT & Communists alliance (civil war on hold)
- Summer 1938, Japan pushed KMT to interior
- Mao's PLA was more successful in combating Japan
- Mao:
	- popular b/c Red Army resisted Japanese invaders
	- success = mobility, flexibility, hit & run, people's support, & use enemies limitations
- Chiang lost mass support because failed to react effectively to threat & tainted by corruption & aid from USA
- USSR declared war on Japan in WWII, invaded Manchuria & left with \$2 billion in industrial machinery.

>"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"


## Civil War 1945-1949

Summer 1945 Mao liberated most of Northern China from Japaneses & won public support

Chiang & KMT continued to advance after WWII & captured Yenan but KMT supported by Americans & were tainted

Mao launched conventional war against KMT
- by 1948 PLA = 3 million 
- supported & supplied by peasants 
- better trained

- really 20 years
- simultaneously nationalist war against foreign occupation & struggle to establish communism
- not classic Marxist because peasants not workers leading revolution
- open struggle, not conspiracy like Lenin's

1949 Chiang & 1.5 million KMT fled to Taiwan & set up **Nationalist China**

USA recognized Taiwan/Chiang as official government of China & USA wouldn't let Communist China into UN

Oct.1 1949 Mao proclaimed
	**People's Republic of China**

# Mao Tse-Tung Consolidation of Power: 1949-1954

### Mao's China: 1949-1976

1. Mao's communist Rule in China:
	People's Republic of China Oct.1, 1949
	- Mandate from Heaven: old tradition where new rulers gained right to rule simply because they had seized power
	- Democratic Centralism: obedience to leaders, central control

### Conference Sept. 1949

- non-communist parties & others who opposed KMT/GMD brought under communist leadership
- temporary constitution in a multi-party "people's democratic dictatorship" (communist dominance)
- non-reactionaries granted a vote in the elected National People's Congress but choice of candidates limited

## Non-people with NO political rights

5 **Black** categeries:
- reactionary elements
- feudal elements
- lackeys of imperialism
- bureaucratic capitalists
- enemies of the people

> Included: landlords, business owners & prominent ex-KMT

Exception: **National Bourgeoisie** & **Petit Bourgeoisie** given civil rights because skill & expertise needed in early years.

## 1954 formal Constitution

- China = single-party state
- Mao = Chairman of National People's Congress (head of government)
- 2 Vice-chairmen & council of ministers led by a PM (Chou Enlai PM 1949-1976)

## Population Organization

- Everyone organized into groups each led by a local party cadres 

shared groups comments by reporting up chain of command to central committees - politburo in Peking/Beijing -> "educate" group on policies -> **Cadres**

> Maoist ideology = peasants, soldiers, workers could influence official decisions

## Mass Mobilization Campaigns

1. Suppression of counter-revolutionaries began March 1950-1951: People with links to the KMT/GMD, criminal gangs or religious groups
2. Suspicion of foreigners: west (USA b/c Korea)
3. Three antis campaign 1951
	Against corruption, waste & obstruction (struggle session, humiliation, group pressure)
4. Five Antis Campaign 1952
	- Against theft, bribery, cheating government contracts, economic espionage, tax evasion (employers = self-criticisms & "thought reform", fines, labour camps, property confiscation)
	- Confession = pay dues & return to work (unlike landlord executed in Agrarian  Reform)
	- ~ 2-3 million suicides due to humiliation

## June 1950 Agrarian Land Reform Passed

> Land was taken from landowners & supposedly redistributed peacefully Chinese peasants "denounced " landowners who went before the Peoples' Tribunal this man was probably executed (about 5 million were killed)

## The first Five Year Plan; 1953

Communist 1st economic plan to increase standard of living

Similar to USSR NEP
	- State controlling major industries
	- peasants could sell surplus after taxes
Plan included aid from USSR & emphasis on heavy industry (coal, steel, oil, electric power)
 
Plan successful but paid for at expense of peasantry & small industry

Collectives
	- collectivized land - **APC**'s (Agricultural Producers Co-operatives)
	- collectivization was **unpopular** but Mao could not purge (like Stalin) because his revolution came from peasants so he "encouraged"
		- family co-operatives (30-40 families)
		- collective farms (80-100 families)

## Hundred Flowers Campaign: 1957

Mao encouraged intellects view of communism in an attempt to win them over in Marxist debate

>[!quote]
>
>"let a hundred flowers bloom & a hundred schools of thought compete"

Criticism of communism = fast & furious
> "fragrant flower = poisonous weeds"

Mao ended campaign = some intellects joined Mao & others were punished

## Mao as Chairman 1958

>"considering the future of communism"

- Liu Shao Chi = President

## Great Leap Forward: 1958-62

- 2nd Five Year Plan = "Walking on Two Legs"
- Central planning aside for local organization
	- industrialization & agricultural output
	- lack mechanization = hard manual labour
- Focus on backyard steel mills or "backyard furnaces", irrigation canals, hydro dams
- Cooperatives & collectives into 28000 communes (25000 people to commune)
	- by 1958, 99% farms part of a commune
	- commune responsible for local government (hsiang) roads, hospitals & schools
- Communes too large & family life no longer central
- Drought, floods & Mao's impractical ideas for agriculture (planting grain & killing birds) = problems
- 1960 USSR pulled out advisors
- 1961 communes cut to 1/3 of size & decisions returned to villages sized collective farms

> Great Leap Forward 
> - successes ( 1970's dramatic increase in industrial production)
> - failures (famine, extreme hard labour, low standard of living)

> Consolidation 1949-54

## Great Famine

- people ded

# Maintaining Power

## The Cultural Revolution: 1966-69

	- Lin Biao (Minister of Defence)

- Closed universities & schools
	- Reviewed curriculum

- Red guard (organized youths) 1967
	- revisionsts

- Red Guard too violent = PLA restored order

- 1969 cultural revolution officially over
	- school & universities re-opened but education more "red"
	- many government officials dismissed
	- "going down" & "barefoot doctors" common

- Lin Piao
	- Declared Culture Revolution over 1969
	- 1971 died in plane crash (Theory: escape to USSR after attempting to overthrow Mao)

- Chou En Lai attempts to unit orthedox and revisionist
