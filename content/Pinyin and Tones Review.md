# Position of Tone Marks

1. Tone marks are **always** placed above vowels
2. When there are **two vowels**, the tone mark is placed on the vowel in the following order: 
   
   | a   | e   | i   | o   | u   | ü   |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

For example: 

for 老 **lao**, the tone mark would be on the **a** (lǎo) 
for 会 **hui**, the tone mark would be on the **i** (huì)

>[!warning] Exception:
>
>for **iu**, the tone mark would be on the **u**
>For example, for jiu, the tone mark would be on the **u**

# Neutral Tone

*A particle at the end of a sentence:*

example: 吗 ma、呢 ne、吧 ba、啊 a

*When used as a suffix with no strong meaning:*

example: 左边、前面、早上、桌子

*When repeatedly used in a word:*

example: 爸爸、哥哥、叔叔、太太

*When repeating the meaning of, or carrying a softer meaning than its preceding character in a word:*

example: 衣服、耳朵、眼睛、凉快

# Two Third Tones

If two third tones syllables are spoken in succession, the first third tone becomes second tone, orally. For example:

你好 nĭ hăo ->
处理 chǔ lǐ ->

>[!note]

>This change only occurs orally. In writing, do not change the tone marks from third to second tone. For example, 你好 nĭ hăo remains nĭ hăo in writing.
