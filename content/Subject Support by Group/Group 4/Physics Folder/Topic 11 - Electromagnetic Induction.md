## 11.1 Electromagnetic Induction
### Describing Magnetic Fields
#### Representations of Magnetic Fields
- cannot be seen, so must have standard ways to represent
- arrows on field lines point to the direction a force would act on a magnetic north pole 
- distance between field lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field
	- close together is strong, far apart is weak
- analogy: spaghetti 
	- distance between a 3d array of spaghetti is the field strength
#### Relationship between Magnetic Field and Force on Wire
- $F=BIL$ where $F$ is force, $B$ is magnetic field strength, $I$ is current, and $L$ is length
	- see section 5.4
#### Magnetic Flux
- flux: the total number of field lines measured in Webers ($Wb$)
	- analogy: amount of spaghetti in a packet
- flux density: the density of field lines ($Wb\cdot m^{-2}$)
- magnetic field strength == magnetic flux density 
- magnetic flux: magnetic field strength normal to a surface, multiplied by the area of that surface
- formula for flux:
	- $$\phi=BA\cos \theta$$
	- ![[Pasted image 20231206084500.png||300]]
- flux linkage: the total number of times any field line crosses any area
	- $$flux\ linkage = \phi N = BA\cos \theta N$$
