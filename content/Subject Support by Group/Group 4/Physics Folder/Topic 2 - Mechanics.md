>[!#important] ## 2.1 - Motion
### Definitions
- ==Displacement==: a vector, the shortest distance from the initial point to the final point
- Distance: a scalar, the total length of path travelled to get to the final point (including reversals)
- Position: the location of an object at a certain time, relative to the origin
- ==Velocity==: the rate of change of displacement over time ($\frac{s}{t}$)
	- m/s
- Speed: the rate of change of distance over time
- ==Acceleration==: rate of change of velocity over time ($\frac{v}{t}$)
	- m/s^2
### Graphing Motion
- Position-time
	- slope of tangent = instantaneous velocity
	- stationary object = horizontal line
	- constant velocity = linear graph
	- constant acceleration = parabolic curve
- Velocity-time
	- area under curve = acceleration
	- slope of tangent = instantaneous displacement
	- stationary object = horizontal line at 0
	- constant velocity = horizontal line
	- constant acceleration = linear graph
	- non-uniform acceleration = non-linear graph
- Acceleration-time (usually rare)

### Uniformly accelerated linear motion
- definition: straight line motion with constant acceleration, producing constant change in velocity in equal time intervals
- doesn't include:
	- motion varying in magnitude (ex. pendulums)
	- non-linear motion (ex. circular)
- examples:
	- a falling object
- solving equations:
	- ![[Pasted image 20240102195629.png|300]]
	- s = displacement
	- u = initial velocity
	- v = final velocity
	- a = acceleration (the gradient)
	- t = time
	- equations to use: $$\begin{split}s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\\v=u+at\\v^2=u^2+2as\end{split}$$
### Projectile Motion
- the motion of a projectile is a composite motion formed from horizontal and vertical motion
- the components of projectile motion (horizontal & vertical) are independent and do not affect each other
### Checklist
- Distinguish between distance and displacement. 
- Distinguish between velocity and speed. 
- Understand the meaning of acceleration. 
- Understand the distinction between instantaneous velocity and average velocity. 
- Know how to sketch and interpret d–t and v–t graphs. 
- Know how to get the speed from a d–t graph. 
- Know how to get the acceleration from a v–t graph. 
- Know how to get the distance travelled from a v–t graph. 
- Know that bodies falling through a fluid will eventually reach a terminal velocity. 
- Know how to sketch and graph a problem in order to help solve it. 
- Know how to see a projectile problem from two perspectives.

>[!#important] ## 2.2 - Forces
### Definition
- a force has:
	- magnitude and direction (ie. is a vector)
	- an object and location on the object it acts on
	- an object that exerts the force
	- a general type
	- a physical origin
	- units: newtons, $N$
### Graphing
- free body diagram
	- simplified version of object
	- forces as vector areas, to approximate scale
	- axes for coordinates
- drawing free body diagrams:
	- if an object is on something, there is a normal force R present, equal to the force of gravity on the object
### Intro to Force Types
- gravitational
	- weight: 
		- the gravitational force experienced by any object
		- affected by gravitational field strength (dependent on masses and distance)
		- the product of gravitational mass $m$ and field strength $g$
	- when one object is on another, there is a reactional normal force ($R)$ that creates net zero with the force of gravity
	- $F=mg$, where $m$ is the mass and $g$ is gravity (9.81 N/kg)
- frictional
	- opposes motion
	- split into two types:
		- static, when an object is at rest
		- dynamic, when an object is in motion
			- is typically less than static friction
	- caused by:
		- microscopic roughness of surfaces
		- doesn't depend on surface area
		- increased by normal force on the surface (as interlocking increases)
			- however not necessarily proportional (as surfaces can be deformed)
		- a constant friction coefficient
			- again not necessarily true and due to deformation
	- $F=\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the friction coefficient (between 0 and 1) and R is the normal force
- tension
	- directed along a rope, away from its ends
- fluid drag
	- acts on an object in fluid, opposing motion
		- caused by displacement of fluid particles
	- depends on:
		- fluid density
		- drag coefficient (how easily fluid flows around the shape of the object)
		- cross-sectional area of the object
		- speed of the object
	- magnitude:
		- proportional to velocity and low smooth flow rates
		- square of velocity at turbulent flow rates
