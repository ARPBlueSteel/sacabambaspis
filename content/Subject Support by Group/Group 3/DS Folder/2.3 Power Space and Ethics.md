# Values and ethics:

## What are values and ethics

- The difference between right and wrong / fair and unfair / just and unjust / legal and illegal / proper and improper

>[!note] Values:  
> - Something we hold into consideration when making a decision
> - Something that motivate people to act one way or the other

>[!tldr] Ethics: 
> - What is generally considered humanely correct
> - Civil code of conduct and moral principles

## Where are our sources of value or ethics

- Parents, family, culture
- Societal standards
- Patriarchy
- Life experience
- Religion

> Note that all the above can change your values and ethics as you go through different experiences

## Values and ethics in society and their purpose

- If stealing is allowed without ethics, society becomes order-less
- Values help us grow and take steps toward what we want to accomplish
- Is it ethical to mace someone if they follow you home?
	- Perhaps, for self-defence?
	- Reasonable limits on one’s freedom to travel/follow people around

At the end of the day, no conclusion

## Three different ethical frameworks

- Virtue / character based ethics
	- Decision about right and wrong based on the stakeholders and their perspectives
- Deontological / rule based ethics
	- Decision based on the action itself 
	- Focuses on the following moral rules and principles
- Utilitarian / consequential based ethics
	- Decision based on overall consequence of the action
	- Focuses on whether the action leads to the best overall results or consequences for everyone affected by it

### Scenario A

>[!question] Scenario A
>A company has developed a new software that can accurately predict when employees are likely to leave their jobs.
>
>The software analyzes various data points, including employees' age, gender, job title, salary, performance ratings, and time with the company.
>
>The company is considering whether to use the software to proactively offer employees retention incentives or to keep the information confidential to avoid any of intrusive monitoring.


#### Character-Based
The company may want to cultivate virtues such as honesty, fairness, and respect for employees' privacy. 
- Using the software to proactively offer retention incentives may align with these virtues, as it shows a commitment to retaining employees and valuing their contributions.
- On the other hand, keeping the information confidential may also align with the virtue of respect for privacy.

#### Rule-Based

Ethical principle that may apply is duty to employees' privacy. 
- If using the software to proactively offer retention incentives risks violating employees' privacy, the company may have a duty to keep the information confidential.
Another ethical principle that may apply
is the duty to act in the best interests of
employees.
- If the company believes that offering retention incentives will benefit employees, it may have a duty to use the software to proactively offer the incentives.

## Responsibility vs accountability

**Responsibility:**
- Something that you are responsible for
- You acknowledge it before taking action

**Accountability**
- Accepting the consequences of the actions
- The obligation to answer for the task or the outcome of that duty
