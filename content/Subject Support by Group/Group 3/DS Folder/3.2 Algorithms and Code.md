# Algorithms
## What is an algorithm?
- A set of instructions that tell you how to do something step by step
- In computers, algorithms are also considered a set of instructions or rules that the computer uses to solve a problem or perform a specific task
	- Used in many different areas, such as computer programming, math, science, everyday life
- Ex. google search engine
	- Uses an algorithm to determine what results to show you based on your query
- Algorithms can be simple and complex
	- Can be written in various programming languages or represented in various forms
	- Ex. flowcharts or code

## Characteristics of an algorithm

**Well defined inputs and outputs**
- An algorithm intakes specific inputs and produces well defined outputs
- The inputs and outputs should be clearly defined and understood to ensure that the algorithm performs the desired task accurately

**Clear and unambiguous instructions**
- An algorithm consists of a series of instructions that are clear and precise and unambiguous
- Each step of the algorithm should be easy to understand and leave no room for interpretation or ambiguity

**Finite steps**
An algorithm must have a finite number of steps

It should eventually terminate/stop and produce a results, either by:
- Reaching a solution
- Indication that no solution is possible

Infinite loop or recursive cycles should be avoided in a good algorithm

**Deterministic**
An algorithm is deterministic
- Means that it will produce the same output for the same input every time it is executed
	- Aka the algorithm must be consistent

> Meat analogy: decapitation: if it is a good algorithm then each time the cow is decapitated then the head will fall in the basket. If the cow gets decapitated and the head starts floating then there is a problem in your algorithm
> 	**Good algorithm** = decapitated head will fall in basket
> 	**Bad algorithm** = decapitated head will start floating (then you fucked up big time)

**Well defined computational complexity**
- An algorithms complexity, in terms of time and space requirements, should be well defined and understood
- It is important to analyze and optimize the algorithms efficiency and resource usage to ensure it can be executed in a reasonable amount of time and with limited resources

**Correctness**
- An algorithm must be designed to produce the correct output or result for the given inputs and problem it is intended to solve
- The correctness of an algorithm can be verified through rigorous testing and verification techniques

**Modularity**
- An algorithm can be modular
	- It can be broken down into smaller, manageable steps or sub problems
	- Allows for easier implementation, debugging, and maintenance of the algorithm

**Reproducibility** 
- An algorithm’s steps and instruction should be well documented and reproducible, allowing for other to understand and reproduce the results

**Flexibility**
- An algorithm should be flexible enough to accommodate different input values and variations of the problem it is designed to solve
- Should be able to handle different cases and adapt accordingly

## Components of an algorithm

1. Instructions:
	- Steps or actions that the algorithm follows to perform a task or solve a problem
	- Each instruction must be clear, prices, and unambiguous to ensure that the algorithm performs correctly

2. Variables
	- Data values that are used and manipulated by the algorithm as it processes the input and produces the output
	- Variables can represent different types of data
		- Ex. numbers, text, or boolean values

2.  Conditionals
	- Logical statements that evaluate whether a certain condition is true or false
	- Based on the result of of this evaluation, the algorithm can take different paths or perform different instructions

3.  Loops
	- Structures that allow the algorithm to repeat a set of instruction multiple times
	- Either for a fixed number of iterations or until a certain condition is met

## Ways of representing algorithm

 Natural language
- Most basic and simple way of explaining an algorithm
- Involves pain and simple language steps of an algorithm

Flowchart
- Graphical representation of an algorithm,
- Uses symbols and arrows to show the low of the algorithm, from input of data to the output of data

Programming language
- Formal language used to write computer programs
- Involves writing code using a specific syntax and structure that the computer can understand and execute


## Uses of algorithm


**Two main functions:**

1. Prioritization algorithm
	- A sorting algorithm used to prioritize tasks after learning from input from users
2.  Association rule of algorithm
	- Uses algorithm to collect data and reveal how items are associated with each other and reveals the relationship between different items in a database

## Real world uses of algorithms

Search engines
- Used to determine search rankings
- provide relevant search results for users

Social media
- Used to personalize news feeds
- recommended content based on user interests and behavior

Financial systems
- Used to analyze financial data
- make investment decisions

Medical diagnosis
- Used to analyze medical data
- provide diagnoses based on symptoms and other factors

Transportation systems
- Used to optimize routes
- schedules for transportation like buses, trains, and planes

E-commerce
- Used to recommend products to users based on their browsing history and purchase history

Fraud detection
- Used to analyze transactions
- detect potential fraudulent activity in banking and other industries

Weather forecasting
- Used to analyze weather data
- provide accurate forecasts and warnings

Gaming
- Used to power game engines
- Provides realistic physics simulations and other effects

Robotics
- Used to control and coordinate the movements of robots in industrial and other applications

## Algorithmic dilemmas

Human errors
- Failure to program a fail safe for the robot
Algorithm may take things too seriously
- Lack of critical thinking skills
Potential to reflect the stereotypes and biases of society

## Algorithmic bias

Formed when an algorithm develops with a dataset that doesn't represent the entire population / the dataset used is biased towards certain groups
- The algorithm then uses this biased data and makes predictions based on the patterns its finds
- Leads to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, as the algorithm may perpetuate existing biases in society
- For example, [Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist) 

Algorithmic bias is created from:
	- Human bias
	- Lack of diversity 
	- Lack of conscience
	- Human input leads to bias

Ex. amazon recruitment algorithm in 2018
	- In 2018, it was revealed that amazon was using a ai power recruiting tool that was biased against women
		- This was the result of the algorithm being trained on the resumes of past job applicants, most of whom were men
	- This results in the algorithm learning to prefer male candidates and subsequently proceeded to downgrades resumes that contained words like women or female


>the algorithm above was trained on data that was biased towards men, as as a result learned to prefer male candidates over female candidates
>
>The bias was not intentional, but rather a result of the data used to train the algorithm


## Black box algorithms

- An algorithm that provide insight without clarity on how the conclusions were reached from the data input
- Lacks transparency as you are not enable to understand how it came to be
- Think of it as a box where you insert an orange and it gives you back an apple. You then input the apple and you get a banana as an output. 

>### Proper algorithm:
> |input|process|output|
> |---|---|---|
> |orange|Orange -> fruit -> sweet & sour -> apple|apple|

> ### Black box algorithm
> |input|process|output|
> |---|---|---|
> |orange|?????????|Box of tissues|
