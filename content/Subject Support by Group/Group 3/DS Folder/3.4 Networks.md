## Network components

### The different kind of network

##### Personal Area Network (PAN)
“A network of your own personal area phone, laptop” - Abdu
- Examples: Bluetooth that connects your phone and headphones to transfer data (song streams, etc.)
##### Local Area Network (LAN)
“Devices connect to a single location like your home or office, where only a limited number of people are connected to it” - Raymond


##### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
“Computers connect to a network that is within a city or metro area” - Michael

##### Wide Area Network (WAN)
A huger network that you can access with credentials despite being in different areas
- Example: SD38 network, the internet

### Types of connectivity

##### Wired networks
**Ethernet cable**
- Connects faster and smoother than wireless networks because it is a direct connection (like driving a highway with no obstacles/other cars)

##### Wireless networks
**WiFi**
- Not was fast as wired networks, but is must more versatile and convenient
- Can connect multiple devices without need for a wired connection
- Not limited by space as much as wired connection (with wired you have to lug a cable around no matter where you go, limits your freedom and movement) 

##### Cloud networks
- Even more wireless. “Wireless networks” can include local networks such as Bluetooth, while Cloud networks can be connected to anywhere in the world
- WAN that host resource using cloud-based tech, virtual firewalls, etc.
- Ex. iCloud storage


#### Servers
Computer hardware or software (computer programs) that are assigned responsibilities and functionalities for other programs and device
- This program and device and they serve is called “clients”


>This whole process of having a server (think Servent) serving a client is the classic client-server model
