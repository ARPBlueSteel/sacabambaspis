## DIKW Pyramid

**Data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW)** pyramid
- Hierarchy that represents the structural and functional relationships between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom
- Each step answers different questions about the initial data and adds value to it

### Data
A collection of facts in raw, neutral, unorganized form
 Ex.:
 - numbers, characters, 
 - 3.14
 - A, O, d, w, 1
 Without context, **data means nothing**

### Information
- Data becomes **information** when it is process into a format that is logical, error-free, easier to measure, visualize, and analyse for a specific purpose
- **Aggregation:** combining different sets to compare contrast
- **Validation:** to prove that the collected data is relevant & accurate
- Ex. stock market index (tesla's earning report lower than expected, stock market crashes) (great depression 2, the electric boogaloo)
- Information can be derived from data when we ask **who, what, where, when**
- *But it does not tell us ***HOW**

### Knowledge
- A logical description of collected facts (data)
- When we don't just view information as a description of collected facts, but also understand how to apply it to achieve our goals. We turn it into **knowledge**
- When one entity (student, company, team) gains more knowledge than the other party, they gain the competitive edge (ex. The use of machine learning to enhance photo quality for google pixel phones)(explains why my photos look like shit)
### Wisdom

- Knowledge **applied in action**
- *Knowledge only becomes wisdom when you take action*
- If after you learned the knowledge, but you just sit there and do nothing, then that knowledge doesn't turn into wisdom

## Types of Data

### Qualitative
- Non-statistical
- Typically unstructured or semi structure
	- Data not measured using numbers to derive a conclusion
	- Based on data properties, attributes, labels, etc.
	- Used as a start for asking ‘why” questions (ex. Why is the paper due tomorrow?)
	- Deals with **non-numerical data** (concepts, descriptions, meanings, words etc.)
- Generating this data from qualitative research is used for theorizations, interpretations, developing hypothesis, and initial understandings
- Qualitative data identifies can be subjective, making qualitative data analysis a complex processes

### Quantitative

- Statistical
	- Typically structured and defined in nature
	- Measured using numbers and values, making it suitable for data analysis
	- Prompts the question of “how much” & “how many” with conclusive information (ex. How much time left until i have to write the paper / how many skittles will it take to bribe mr poon to delay the paper)
	- There are two types of quantitative data: Continuous & discrete data

#### Continuous
- Data that **can be infinitely broken down** into smaller parts or data that **continuously fluctuates**
- Ex. your heart rate (very fast), the speed of a car while driving, your weight, your age

#### Discrete

- Data that **cannot be broken down** into smaller parts 
- Consists of integers
- **Is finite and has a limit**
- Ex. how much money is in my wallet (none), how many hours left until my death at the hands of this paper?)

### Cultural Data

- Data related to art, humanities, and cultural studies
- Digitization of items in museums (ex. 3d virtual tours, etc)
- Information on artifacts and history
	- Significant of history - creates community?
- Culture is a big majority of humanity's life

### Other Kinds of Data

- Financial
	- Information related to the financial health of a business
	- Used by internal management to analyze business performance and outside people to judge its credit worthiness and whether to invest or not
	- Ex. assets, liabilities, owners equities, stock price
- Geographical (Geodata)
	- Data and information that has explicit or implicit association with location relative to earth
- Medical (clinical)
	- Health related information that is associated with regular patient care
	- Helps healthcare providers monitor the wellbeing of their patients by montering any emerging trends
	- Ex. blood sugar level, heart rate, virus count within the body, etc.
- Meteorological data
	- **Meteorology:** A branch of the atmospheric sciences (which includes atmospheric chemistry and physics) with a major focus on weather forecasting
	- Data consisting of physical parameters that are measured directly by instruments
	- Ex. temperature, dew point, wind direction, wind speed, etc.
- Transport data
	- Designs and implements studies
	- Develops databases
	- Monitors trends and analysis data relating to all modes of travel
	- Ex. walking, cycling, public transport
- Scientific data
	- Data based on research carried out by researchers
- Statistical data
	- Data based on collected statistics

### Metadata

Metadata is data that provides information about other data, but not the content of the data

**Descriptive metadata**
- Used to identify specific data (ex. authors, titles, keywords)
- Ex. a file named pain and suffering and contains all the TOK essays 

**Structural metadata**
- Organization and classification of data for ease of access (ex. classifying the chapters of a book)
- Ex. the essays being catalogued into different dates 

**Administrative metadata**
- Management of data including rights of who it belongs to (ex. the use and preservation of business data)
- Ex. the IB diploma student who created the folder and all the files within

**Reference metadata**
- Data that describes the quality of statistics data

**Statistical metadata**
- Descriptive information about statistical data

**Legal metadata**
- Underlying data relating to the legal case files for ease of access

## Data Life Cycle

**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SwtzTcRdotKyrcwSnp4gbxjCavryvwKO8CyPeBbypXHpvnyw-t9BeKqnThzHleusTX0yQDQ7Lb9eWr3zdQ88eiZnlc-DwrEMIi1Dh9_ptB7hj8vV1gIrB5OowkEqdHDaZdkr8YumEnGCN7YCBEaUIQ)**

1. **Generation**
	- First stage of data life cycle
	- Every action done digitally generates data
		- Every sale, purchase, hire, communication, interaction
	- Can also be manually entered by hand or completion of online form
	- The generated data can provide powerful insight
2. **Collection/extraction**
	- Not all data that's generated every day is collected or used
		- It is a decision based on the stakeholders perspectives
		- Ex. roomba wants a map of everyone's homes, while amazon wants the buying pattern of their target market
3. **Processes / usage (beginning)**
	- Once the data has been collected, it must be processed from its raw format (think DIKW pyramid)
	- *Data wrangling:* Raw data that has been cleaned and transformed into useful and accessible data
	- *Data compression:* Data transformed into a format that can be efficiently stored (ex. pdf’s)
	- *Data encryption:* data transformed into another code to prevent east access
4. **Storage (beginning)**
	- Once processed and clean, the data needs to be stored (creating a database) into a safe palace with a preset level of security and access so that not everyone can see the data (information is precious after all). They can be stored in the cloud, servers, or local file (physical storage on your computer / hard drives)
5. **Management (the middle)**
	- Aka database management
	- Involves organizing, storing, and retrieving data as necessary over the life of a data project
	- It is an ongoing process from beginning to the end of the data cycle (everything from storage and encryption to implementing access logs)
6. **Analysis (the middle)**
	- Turns raw and/or process data into meanings (patterns, trends, forecast)
	- Some tools and methods include statistical modeling, algorithms, data mining, and two other IT forms (related to the podcast) 
	- Ex. there's a rise of sleep deprivation during the beginning of November, which coincidentally is also when a new song came out and when a new 5-star character in a online game is released (gee i wonder what game)
7. **Visualization (optional depending on situations) the middle)**
	- Turning the analyzed data into visual representations of your information
	- Visualizing data makes it easier to quickl;y communicate your analysis to a wider audience both inside and outside your organization
	- Ex. bar graphs
8. **Interpretation (the middle)**
	- This process is to make sense of your data analysis
	- Beyond simply presenting data, this is when you investigate and try to connect two analysis together
	- Ex. in reference to the previous sleep deprivation example, gamers sleep less (data 1) as they sacrifice sleep grinding for the new 5 star character that was released in november (data 2)
- **Preservation (not on the chart) (the end)**
	- After step 8, you want to publicize this as a fact to the world. While you do that, you want to ensure that the data is preserved and that the quality remains pristine. To do this you need to find a spot to keep your data (on the cloud or on a physical hard drive)
- **Destruction (also not on the chart) (the end)**
	- No data can be kept forever, as the data will eventually become obscure and outdated
	- Depending on the data policy form the company, you may be asked to destroy the data so that it can never be retrieved (ex. When an employee leaves a company, their emails, logins, etc are all scrapped)

### Data Integrity
- A concept and process that ensures the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and validity of an organization's data
- It is important to protect data integrity as it maintains the data authenticity, being transparent
- It also eliminates bias, confusion, and provides valid data that is genuine and factual

#### Commission
- Creating data from nothing
- Ex. doing a lab but you screwed up and instead made up data on the spot for completion marks

#### Omission
- Removing, reducing, or erasing data (choosing specifically what data looks better on that lab you screwed up on)

#### Manipulation
- Changing the data, modifying the data to look more appealing (changing values on the lab so that it looks even more authentic)

### Primary vs Secondary Data

#### Primary data
- Actual picture of a document
- Data from an original source
- First collection of the data (ex. You do a lab and collect data which you use yourself. If a classmates copies from you, then that copied data is now secondary data)

#### Secondary data
- Data that has been collected by someone else
- Not primary source of data
- Ex. the friend you copied off who turns out copied from someone else

## Database

### Database and their structure

**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7RqgGN8L7WOMghzC6_Sz_uO8oocrerQ3TFtzHGzOiCJvndsvKoGmucTO9p1LHV0Nl437xDqJQsCf5ApioYf4G2vJfm8HPt3BBWzWH0jxgNavT8gRHYMnHSUXQyti-MA7JL9NXS11fdDynDSvFFgKFw)**

### Relational Database

- A classic and frequently used database
- Has more than one table, as it is meant to display the relationship between different databases
	- Each **row** is called a ==entity== as that row represents the data for that entirety
	- Different datas are sorted into different tables. A ==primary key== is used to ensure that the data in a specific column is **unique**
	- A ==foreign key== is a column or group of columns in a relation database that provides a **link** between data in two tables
	- After the primary key is not the main attribute anymore, it becomes a ==foreign key==
	- The model also accounts for the types of relationships between those tables, including:
		- One to one 
		- One to many
		- Many to many

### Reduce Data Error

- Use of **Validation**
	- Means that only suitable/valid data can be entered into the database
- Use of **Verification**
	- Used when you want to check the data to ensure the data entered is actual correct data that you want to be in the database
	- This can be easily done using methods such as peer review.

## Data Security

### Why is data security important?
Protects a company from financial loss, reputation harm, loss of customer trust
>Side note: ==whenever reading articles, always identify at least 2 key stakeholders==

Solutions:
- Data encryption
- Enhanced data security
- Data masking - turn data into fictional data
