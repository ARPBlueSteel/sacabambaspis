# Computer

### What makes a computer a computer?
- An electronic device that can perform various operations and tasks based on instructions given to it

**Hardware includes:**
- Input devices (mouse, keyboard, etc)
- Processing unit (CPU)
- Memory (RAM)
- Output devices (monitor, speakers, etc)

**Software includes:**
- Operating software (windows, mac OS, etc)

 >“What makes a computer a computer is: its ability to take input, processes it, store information, and output the results”

## Two types of computers

**Embedded computers: **

Specialized computer systems that are integrated into other devices or products
Designed to perform specific functions or tasks

**Pro:** Optimized for efficiency, reliability, and const effectiveness
**Con:**  Often smaller and less powerful than typical computers

>[!example]
>Microwaves, ATMs, GPS, central heating


**Personal computers** 

Computers that are designed for individual use
Includes all the previously mentioned components

**Pro:** Easy to customize and upgrade
**Con:** Break down easily (you drop a microwave, it will still “work”. If you drop a pc then you will go in debt cuz that pc is not coming back)

## Mainframe computers & servers

Mainframe:
- High performance, large scale computers designed to handle massive amounts of data processing and storage for large organizations
- Usually help in dedicated data centres 
    

- Known for their reliability, scalability, and security features
    

- Typically used for applications that require a extremely high level of processing power and memory
    

- Aka when you need millions to billions of calculations done in a short span of time
    

- Mainframe computers are often used as servers
    
- Ex. financial transactions, airline reservations, healthcare management, scientific research
    
- Meat analogy: warehouse for storing and processing the meat
    
- Con: 
    

- often very expensive to buy and maintain
    

- Regardless of that it is still widely used by major corporations and government agencies due to their processing power and reliability
    

- Example of a mainframe computer
    

- IBM Z SYSTEMS
    
- ![i am too lazy to type this all out and its an example](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qBDbFmSopR4SVCBv9qLN1tyx7Rg2c-LHsK2iaETSHebF7-_2xcLi9DVkECPE4TW1u1sTKUITePX2YfFknWG3ybhGFNNROSSLsnYB_x3tMGp4QR02TKfsGVHNKb67ljWoPuhq0VDG-odAtG9hnV81AA "text")
    

- Server:
    

- A computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, aka the client
    
- Think of it as the manager who will take your request and then have employees complete separate parts of the request, before compiling all the parts together to give you your output
    
- Analogy: 
    

- You want a sword, and so you go to the blacksmith (aka the server). The blacksmith will then source out all the necessary materials (iron, wood, tools), and then it will take those materials and process them into the output, which it will then give to you 
    

- Side note: 
    

- Error 404 occurs when the blacksmith can’t find wtf you want
    

### Computer components

#### Components of a computer

- All computers possess:
    

- Central processing unit (CPU)
    
- Motherboard
    
- Graphics processing unit (GPU)
    
- Random access memory (RAM)
    
- Storage (SSD or HDD)
    
- PSU
    
- Display monitor
    

#### CPU

- The brain of the computer where calculations are processed
    

- Everything we do on the computer is broken down into another language that fetches, decodes, and executes the instructions we input
    
- The cpu intakes all the data and turns it into instructions for other computer parts to do
    
- Side note: once you figure out your CPU, you can then know what motherboard to get
    

- Cores
    

- Refers to how many processing units are reading and execution program instructions 
    
- You can have 1,2,4,8,16+ cores
    
- Ex. a video editor would want more cores due to the greater demand placed on the computer, but the typical office worker would be fine with dual cores. Regardless quad cores nowadays are a good middle ground
    

- Cache memory
    

- The CPU’s built in RAM that helps access the central memory (the physical RAM stick in your pc) faster
    
- Cache sizes range from 512kb to 16mb (bigger the size the better)
    

- Threads
    

- Tasks that the cpu executes
    
- Similar to cores but is instead powered by the cores
    
- Ex. useful when running “multithreaded” programs such as video editing, programming, 3D rendering
    
- Each core has 2 threads (in most cases)
    

- Clock speed:
    

- The number of pulses the GPU clock generates per seconds
    
- Measured in hertz (hz)
    

- Cpu specs explained
    

-  [CPU Specs Explained (2020) [The Ultimate Guide]](https://youtu.be/xJNkEzy3-O4)
    

- Examples of CPUS

#### Motherboards

- All the parts of the computer system communicate through a circuit board
    

- Connects all parts together (think of it like your skeleton where it acts as a frame that holds everything
    
- Ex. Common motherboards include raspberry pi and Arduino
    

- Tip: motherboards have a specific chipset that supports certain CPUs and sockets
    
- Always double check what socket your CPU requires
    

- This information is clearly labeled in the product name or specification
    

- Three common motherboard form factors: ATX, micro ATX, and Mini-ITX
    
- ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zziUL78PVgPD5h4YHkrh2AI4Ksh-TRsIJD56oLR5v4BoSlP1wBELsj4nhMiXGypVkm0ZdBX0szqItCAuy43dkwMo3gyj8XqflyIBROBE5JkYgtSBZSVgboiOLi_G5el8ck3tpYHxCAGzh_DYPfCSFg)
    
- Each motherboard have different sizes and compatibility of PCIe (aka Peripheral Component Interconnect express) slots
    

- Ex. GPU, RAM, SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) ports


- Most common board form is ATX with up to 8 RAM slots, 4 GPU slots, and 12 SATA ports

Cheap vs expensive
- Good (and expensive) motherboards often provide more reliable connectivity and contain more slots
- Motherboard prices range from $50-$1500

> **Bottomline:**
>- $150 - $180 mid-range boards are good for regular users
>- $250+ are for PC enthusiasts or when you really need the extra ports


### GPU

Used to render images, videos, animations for display
- Have their own “VRAM” (Video RAM) so that it doesn't use up the PC’s RAM to do graphics calculations
- Note that even if you have a very powerful GPU but a crappy monitor, the graphics will still be bad. The opposite is also true

**GPU explained:**

### RAM

Stores data (volatile memory) for frequently accessed programs 
- Such as web browsers, finder folders, and all the applications that you open (hence why the meme of Chrome eating up your RAM exists)

If you open too many apps and your RAM gets overloaded, your computer will become slow
- Fix: restarting your pc, as it will erase it all and clear up the RAM

> **Bottom line:**
> - 8GB of RAM is a good place ($60 - $90)


### Storage (SSD or HDD)

All computers need to store data such as videos, images, etc. which stay permanently on your computer (until you delete it)

**HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**
- Made of an actual disk onto which data is stored
- Disk is read by an mechanical arm 
- Think of it like a CD and CD reader combined into one

**SDD (Solid State Drive)**
- Have no moving parts and are faster than a hard drive due to lack of time spent waiting for a mechanical arm to find data on a physical location on the disk
- They do this by storing data inside a integrated circuit, usually using flash memory (which means data is written, transferred, and erased electronically)
- Think SD cards


Generally, HDD’s are cheaper than SSD’s (but SSD’s can be significantly smaller and contain more storage)



>[!note] Analogy: 
>- HDD is like writing down the information on something like a piece of paper or on your arm. You need to take time to find the specific piece of info
>- SDD is like memorizing the information in your brain and actively choosing what information to keep, what to forget, etc.

# Power

Ex. the differences in voltage between nations
- Canada standard voltage is 120 V
- Japan standard voltage is 100 V

This results in some devices not working in japan as they were made to utilize 120 V.

This difference in voltage is due to historical and technical reasons
- Different countries developed their own electrical systems and standards
- Over time those difference were standardized and incorporated into national electrical codes

Many countries also have different power grids and electrical infrastructure, which may affect the voltage.
- Some places have older infrastructure that cannot handle higher voltages, while others have the newer infrastructure, allowing for high voltages.

## How digital devices get power
- Most PC’s use a built-in power supply (aka the b r i c k)
- This converts AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current) and supplies the computer with the required amount of voltage to operate

## Lithium-ion batteries

- Used by most digital devices
- Are like tiny containers filled with chemicals that can create a flow of electricity

When a battery is connected to a device, the chemicals start to move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode through the electrolyte
- This movements of chemicals creates a flow of electrons (aka electricity)

When you charge a lithium-ion battery, the flow of chemicals is reversed, causing electrons to go back to the negative electrode.
- This process stores energy in the battery

When you use the device, the process starts again, as chemicals start to move between the negative electrode to the positive electrode, creating a flow of electricity to power the device

>[!note] Pros and cons of lithium-ion batteries
>>[!check] Pros
>>High energy density
>>- They can store a lot of energy relative to their small size and weight (perfect for small devices like phones)
>>
>>Low discharge rate
>>- They can hold their charge for a very long time, even when not in use
>
>>[!fail] Cons: 
>>Sensitive to high temps
>>- Can cause the batteries to degrade more quickly
>>
>>Dangerous if overcharged
>>- Can cause them to overheat and potentially catch on fire or explode (hence where the saying don't plug your phone onto a computer charger comes from) (but that's not gonna stop me from doing exactly that tho)

# Software

> A collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks and operations

There are different types of software that make up a computer system:
- Operating software
- Utility software
- Application software


## Operating software

> Software program that acts as a link between user and computer hardware

- Manages and controls computer hardware resources, 
- provides a user interface
- enables execution of software applications
- Provides a platform for running programs and managing files and processes
- Also provides a way for us to interact with the computer, through things like buttons, windows, and menus

**The OS is the boss of the computer, as it tells the computer what to do and how to do it**

## UX/UI
### User experience (UX) 
> refers to how a person feels and interacts with a product / system, such as websites, applications, or software

- Focuses on enhancing user satisfaction by improving usability, accessibility, and overall enjoyment of the users interaction with the product
- Focuses on enhancing user satisfaction

### User Interface (UI) 

> refers to the visual elements and interactive features of a product that facilitate the users interaction

Includes components such as:
- Buttons
- Icons
- Menus
- Layouts

Enables users to navigate and interact with the product
- Design focuses on creating visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that are easy to understand and use

>[!example]
>- Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the interface that you see,
> - Haptic interface is the experience that allows your sense of touch to add into the product (such as vibrations, clicks, etc)

## Utility software and application software

### Utility software

> Refers to a type of software designed to perform specific tasks or provide functionality that helps enhance the performance, maintenance, an management of a computer system

- Typically used to optimize system performances, troubleshoot issues and perform various system-related tasks
- Think: utility software = software that is actively utilized by your computer

> [!example]
> Antivirus software, File compression, file management, etc


### Application software a.k.a Apps
> Refers to a type of computer software that is designed to perform specific tasks for users

- Range from productivity tools and communication software to entertainment and gaming application
- Think: Application software = Apps

>[!example]
>Microsoft Word (word processors)
>Gmail (email clients)
>Minecraft (Games)

## Open source and proprietary
Another way to classify software is the ownership and licensing of software.

There are two types

### Open source

>Software that is freely available to the public and allows users to view, modify, and distribute its source code

- Encourages transparency, collaboration, and customization, as anyone can access and modify the source code according to their needs

>[!example]
>firefox browser, Linux OS

### Proprietary software
>Software that is privately owned and disturbed by a specific company or individual

- The source code is not freely available to the public, and users typically need to purchase a license to use the software (so like a rental)
- The company or individual retains **exclusive** rights over the software and controls its development, distribution, and modifications

>[!example]
>Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, 

## Malware

>Any program or code that has malicious intent of doing harm to your computer

- File or code, usually delivered over a network, that infects, explores, steals, or conducts virtually any behaviours an attacker wants

>[!note] More info:
>[What is Malware? Malware Definition, Types and Protection](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) 

## Generation of computing

This site explains everything, read this first. It’ll make more sense:
[Topic A: Computer generations](https://opentextbc.ca/computerstudies/chapter/classification-of-generations-of-computers/) 


### First gen
- Vacuum tube computers
- Used magnetic drums and magnetic tapes as storage
- Used up a lot of electricity and generated a lot of heat
- Was very slow and large
- Ex. IBM 650

### Second gen:
- Transistor computers
- Still used the same methods as storage
- Due to advancements it used less power, thus generated less heat and was smaller in size
- Increased speed and reliability
- Ex. IBM 1401

### Third gen:
- Used integrated circuits
- Used large magnetic core or magnetic tape/disk as storage
- Smaller, cheaper, and more efficient than the previous gen
- Rise of microcomputers
- Use of keyboard, monitor, printer etc as input output
- Ex. IBM 360

### Fourth Generation + quantum computing:
- Used Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) (millions or billions of transistors are put onto a single chip) and microprocessors
- Used semiconductor memory (RAM, ROM, etc)
- Smaller, cheaper, and more efficient than third gen (starting to see a trend here hm?)
- Improvement in speed, accuracy, reliability
- Used keyboard, mouse, optical scanners, monitor, printer, etc as input output
- First to use network
- Ex. IBM PC 

>[!note] Quantum Computing 
>- Quantum computing involved the study and development of technologies based on the principles of quantum theory
> - Used the unique behaviors of quantum physics to solve problems too advanced/complex for classical computing

### Fifth Generation

- Uses Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI) and parallel processing method
- Consumed less power and generated less heat

## Humans and computers
>[!question] Are humans evolving along with computers?
> - Provide examples of how humans have evolved thanks to computers improvement
> - Increased access to information 
> - Improved communications (connecting the world)
> - Advanced problem solving skills (the computer is able to perform much more complex operations, allowing humans to engage intricate problems in fields such as medicine, science, engineering, etc)
> - Automation and efficiency (automated many simple taste, allowing humans to refocus their efforts, improving productivity)
> - Medical advancements (MRI and CT machines)

  
>[!question] Are humans devolving along with computers?
> - Provide examples of how humans devolved due to the emergence of technology
> - Social isolation and reduced interpersonal skills
> - Information overload and hence decreased critical thinking
> - Addiction and dependency
> - Privacy and security concerns
> - More inactive lifestyles and Health issues

## Moore's law

Moore's law is an **observation** and **prediction** made by Gorden Moore (co-founder of intel)

>[!quote]
>“The number of transistors and resistor double every two years"

Following this law, computers will need more electricity as they increase in processing power and the need for better cooling

>[!question] Moore's law is dead?
>- No exponential performance increase despite double the cores
>- No need anytime soon
>- Budget issues
