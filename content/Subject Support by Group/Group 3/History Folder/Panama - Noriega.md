# General Manuel Noriega

Manuel Antonio Morena Noriega was born of humble beginnings in Panama in 1940. At that time there was no indication that "Tony" Noriega would achieve dictatorship over the country of his birth. He became a dictator with such a corrupt power base and rule that he would come to trial on charges of masterminding what has been called "the enterprise". The enterprise was defined as one of the larges international cocaine smuggling conspiracies in history.

In 1962, Noriega began his military ascent to power when he was commissioned in the National Guard. His climb continued when in 1970-71 he became chief of the Panamanian Intelligence. At this juncture the abuse of power began, Lieutenant Col. Noriega began garnering profits from drug deals. Noriega was stopped by Col. Omar Torrijos who had taken him under his wing.

Noriega was a long time ally of the United States. Recruited by the CIA as early as 1960, he acted as an important information link on both Cuban and other Latin American activities which were deemed contrary to US interests. He rose in the ranks and eventually became head of the military dictatorship that utilized an "elected" puppet government to maintain its power. Through government and military control, he was also vital to US policy makers in illegally funding and supplying the Nicaraguan Contras after allocations by the US Congress were slashed in 1984.

From 1982-1984 General Noriega and his cohorts allegedly allowed Panama to become the trans-shipment point for hundreds of kilos of cocaine. In addition to colluding with the various drug cartels for shipments, money laundering operations and bribery were commonplace.

Torrijos died in 1981, setting the stage for three years of before elections were held in 1984. By then the all-powerful Panamanian Defense Forces, headed by Noriega, backed Nicolas Artito Barletta, a former World Bank vice-president who had close ties to the United States.

Noriega was free to consolidate power. One of his first acts was to have the Legislative Assembly approve a bill to restructure the National Guard, which thereafter would operate under the name of Panama Defense Forces (Fuerzas de Defensa de Panama - FDP). Nominally, the president of the republic would head the FDP, but real power would be in the hands of Noriega, who assumed the new title of commander of the FDP. The defense bill passed in September 1983, which had given the FDP. The Defense bill passed in September 1983, which had given the FDP control over all security forces and services.

Controversy also began to surround Noriega in the mid 1980's regarding DEA allegations that he was a major player in the illegal trafficking of narcotics. This factor, coupled with Congressional scrutiny of the region and Noriega's ties to the US during the Iran-Contra Scandal, painted Noriega as a political liability for President Reagan and his eventual successor George H.W Bush.

Noriega grabbed the spotlight (though again negatively) in 1987 when his former Chief of Staff Diaz Herrera went public with evidence that Noriega rigged the 1984 Panamanian Presidential Elections and murdered Hugo Spadafora, a chief rival to his acquisition of power. Herrera's remarks gave life to opposition groups. The most notable of which was the Civic Crusade for Justice and Democracy.

By late 1987, panama's political system was unable to respond to the problems confronting the nation. Protests over the role in the government played by the Panamanian Defense Forces and their commander, General Noriega, had produced economic disruption and the appearance of political instability and had contributed to serious strains in relations with the United States.

By 1988 relations with the US began to sour as it became apparent that the previous activities of drug trafficking, racketeering, money laundering. and human rights violations were continuous. General Noriega was indicted by the US Attorney's office in Miami.

In 1989, with 10 million dollars in US support, Guillermo Endara defeated the Noriega supported Carlos Duque in the US monitored presidential elections in Panama. Noriega nullified the vote and appointed Duque. In October of that same year, a US engineered coup attempt failed to remove Noriega from power. The US offered one final ultimatum to Noriega that was again ignored.

At approximately one in the morning on December 20, 1989, under the operation name "Just Cause". 24000 US troops invaded Panama. Within hours they secured major military installations and key ports and travel ways. By week's end nearly all of the 15000 PDF had surrendered, and their leader, General Manuel Noriega, was taken prisoner and transported to the US for trial.

On July 10, 1992 the former Panamanian strongman/dictator was sentence to 40 years in prison on 8 counts of drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering. He is presently awaiting an appeal of his sentence. 

# Noriega's military dictatorship in Panama

Peruvian President [[TN Peru's Leaders Belaunde Terry & Velasco Alvarado|Fernando Belaunde Terry]] once remarked **"The paradox of a military, dictatorship is that they stand for both repression and abuse of basic human rights, but at the same time, can be the epitome of order, stability and are reformist."** From 1983 - 1989, Noriega's extreme violation of human rights Ear outweighed his reforms and stability in Panama. In 1983, General Manuel Antonio Noriega (b. 1934 -) emerged as the caudillo of Panama. The death of former leader Omar Torrijos led to Noriega's eventual tyranny. Formerly a deputy of the National Guard (Panamanian military), Noriega promoted himself to the rank of General and renamed his army the 'Panama Defense Forces' (PDF). Thus began six years of institutionalized military dictatorship. In August 1983, Noriega assumed absolute control of the military. Eager to seize power, Noriega elected Nicolas Barletta as an official presidential candidate for the upcoming May 1984 elections. During the ballot-tallying process, Noriega's PDF interrupted counting by opening fire. 3 hours later, 3 people lay dead and 81 civilians wounded. Noriega's puppet president Barletta won by 1713 votes. Thus marked the start of Noriega's abuse of human rights and political repression. 

Noriega openly dealt with illegal drug and arms trafficking, as well as money laundering and the issue of false identification. He earned approximately $10 million US per month from money laundering alone. Noriega was also infamous for his widespread cocaine and arms trafficking, which greatly enriched both the dictator and his associates. 

In September 1985, a political dissident, Hugh Spadafora, was brutally tortured and decapitated. Spadafora had previously accused Noriega of drug trafficking and money laundering. The PDF refused to open an investigation of the death, leading Spadafora's family to appeal to the US Congress, who later proclaimed Noriega guilty. When the US tried to intervene in Panamanian affairs, Noriega ordered the mob attack of the US embassy (June 30, 1987). Other attempts to publicize the corruption and anti-democratic character of Noriega's military resulted in violence and death. 'Black Friday' occurred on July 10, 1987, when political demonstrators were beaten and tortured. 

Usually, military governments are cost-efficient and help civilians in the areas of finance and economy. However, in Panama's case, **Noriega's military dictatorship severely weakened the economy.** By June 1988, economic activity was at 55% of its normal productivity. Unemployment reached a record 12.3%, retail sales off 70%, industrial production off 60%, construction off 95% and agricultural output off 30%. In a show of extreme personalism, Noriega refused to relinquish power, even when faced with manifest opposition. 

Due to Noriega's blatant neglect of human rights and democracy, as well as his illegal dealings, the US invaded Panama on December 20, 1989. 'Operation: Just Cause', ordered by President George Bush, destroyed the war potential of the PDF and captured Noriega, who was flown to Miami to face charges of narcotics trafficking, money laundering and the murder of Hugh Spadafora. By applying Terry's contrast to Panama, it is evident that Noriega's government ruthlessly violated human rights by controlling elections, arbitrarily arresting and torturing political dissidents and participated actively in illegal felonies, such as arms and narcotics trafficking and money laundering. **However, Noriega failed to significantly create order and stability in Panama, as unemployment rates and debt soared, agricultural growth plummeted, and political tension with the United States mounted.**
