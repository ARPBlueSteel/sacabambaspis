# causes of the Russian Revolution

## Social

- Class divisions: The aristocracy had all the wealth & peasants (80% population) were destitute
- In 1861, serf were emancipated but their situation did not improve due to the growing population, illiteracy, lack of knowledge, and lack of land reforms
## Economic

- Industrialization came late to Russia with excessive exploitation (more than W. Europe)
- The result was a small urban proletariat ready for revolutionary ideas and movement

## Political


- Autocracy
	- The Czar was supported by the Orthodox Church & the aristocracy who were dependent on the Czar for status
	- The Czar blocked political reforms
	- After the 1881 assassination, the secret police OKHRANA became oppressive
- In the late 19th century, industrialization began and a new middle class wanted political power with its growing economic power
- Russification was a policy to get rid of the distinctive cultures and promote the Russian language and Orthodox faith
- Nicholas II was considered incompetent

## Intellectual

- Marx's ideas influenced Russian intellectuals in the late 19th century
- As Russia industrialized, revolutionaries saw the application of Marxism to the Russian situation.

# Marxism/Communism

1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote the Communist Manifesto and in 1867 Marx also wrote Das Kapital in 1867

>[!quote] Marx:
>
>"From each according to his abilities; to each according to his needs..."
>
>"The communists...openly declare that their ends can be obtained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletariats have nothing to lose but their chains; they have a world to win. Workers of the world unite!"

Marx believed that the revolution had to develop in an industrial country, either Britain or Germany

Basic Tenets of Marxism:
- man is good by nature
- economic relations determine all human relations
- exploitation is an inherent feature of capitalism
- private property is evil
- capitalism produces two classes of people
- only revolution can rid society of of capitalism and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat
- classlessness & statelessness follow only after revolution & a transition period

# Development of the Communist Party in Russia

1. **The Social Democratic Workmen's Party** began in 1898 with Gregory Plekhanov as its leader. At the party's 1903 congress the party split. Plekhanov controlled the minority of Mensheviks and Vladmir Ilyitch Ulyanov or Lenin controlled the majority or Bolsheviks.
2. **Bolsheviks: Led by Lenin**: Lenin believed that because of the impact of imperialism on Russia, Russia could advance to socialism without going through the capitalist stage. This meant that the Communists could seize power immediately after a bourgeois revolution (fast change). Revolution would be the work of a small group of professional revolutionaries and this revolutionary party would work in secrecy. Therefore, only "trusted" or "True" Marxists could join the party.
3. **Mensheviks: Led by Plekhanov**: Plekhanov believed in "traditional" Marxism which meant that socialism in Russia could develop only AFTER advancing through the stage of capitalism. Mensheviks supported a bourgeois revolution and believed socialism in Russia would be a gradual change following the full development of capitalism in Russia. They also believed that the party should not work in private and be open to membership.
