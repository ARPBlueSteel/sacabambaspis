|propaganda|control of the press through seizure by communist trade unions|

  

from 1968 — Castro follows more USSR development

- state structures and institutions inspired by Soviet
    
- 1972, committee of eight took over Castro’s functions
    

- shift from individual to collective responsibility
    
- more democratic and politically stable
    

- communist party enlarged and reorganized
    

therefore: Castro loses some authority but remains stable despite controversy over economic policies

  

July 26 Movement v. PSP balance

- July 26 Movement was a guerilla army so Castro needed communist PSP’s political experience
    

- experience with party politics and organizing mass movements
    

- [July 1961] July 26 Movement, DR, and PSP form Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI)
    
- PSP initially dominated ORI due to Organization Secretary's pref for old PSP comrades
    
- [Mar 1962] removed Escalante for sectarianism
    

- restructuring of ORI, removing half of its members, mostly PSP faction
    

- Integrated Revolutionary Office becomes United Party of Socialist Revolution
    

- 1963 ORI → PURS
    

- United Party of Socialist Revolution becomes COmmunist Party of Cuba 
    

- 1965 PURS → PCC
    

- consolidates revolutionary power of Cuba 
    

  

Mass Organizations

- Federation of University Students
    

- election in Oct 1959
    
- Castro’s intervention lets PSP candidate win
    
- gives control of university students in favor of unity between communists and non-communists in the J26 movement
    

- Confederation of Cuban Workers
    

- Nov 1959 election
    

- J26 Movement candidates had majority but Castro pushed for unity with communists
    

- 1970 opposition emerged
    

- demonstrated by poor productivity
    
- speech admitting Castro’s mistakes and given greater delegation of powers and democratic methods of consultation

|traditionalist communists of PCC (1965-68)|Castro’s criticism of USSR peaceful coexistence and revolution in developing countries|factionalism|[Feb 1968] many leaders put on trial for factionalism<br><br>- gives more power to Castro|

  

by the mid-1960s most of Castro's oppositions are defeated, so he begins to consider a more liberal approach
