# Unit 1 - Emergence of Auth. State in Cuba

## Overview

- Before 1902, Cuba was a Spanish colony. Nationalist Cubans fought two Wars of Independence against Spain (1868-78, 1895-1898).
- After 4 years of US control, Cuba became independent in 1902. However, the Platt Amendment of 1901 gave the US powers of ‘supervision’ and ‘intervention’.

## 5.3 How significant was the role of ideology in Castro’s rise to power in 1959?

Castro adopted aspects of communist ideology after 1960, but Richard Gott states nationalism was more important, and that Marti was more influential with its emphasis on class conflict.

The main factor to Castro’s rise to power was his movement’s war against Batista, but the stated aims of the movement were important to get public support. These aims were published in manifestos.

### Manifestos

Castro thought manifestos were essential — “Propaganda must not be abandoned for a minute, for it is the soul of every struggle.”

Despite the Caracas Pact, until 1958 there were no serious contact between Castro and Cuban communists. By July 1958, Carlos Rodriguez, a leader of the PSP, joined the rebels in the Sierra and cooperated with the movement. Castro accepted support but made it clear he was in charge.

### Nationalism and cubiana

Castro’s ideology was mainly inspired by:

- radical Cuban nationalism

- from 1868 & First War of Independence
- 1920s & 1930s student rebellions
- 1930s & 1940s anti-imperialist movements in L.A.

- similar as masses vs. elite, and tried to escape US economic interest control

- concept of cubiana

- modernization through socio-economic and cultural development of Cuba
- on Cuban terms, not by capitalism or imperialism
- aimed for economic growth, high social welfare, and socio-economic fairness
- cubiana:

- nationalist concept of protecting Cuban sovereignty while increasing growth in all aspects of community

- ‘Cuba for Cubans’

- inspired by Marti
- a socio-economic and cultural idea, doesn’t address political

Castro believed the 26 July Movement needed to achieve Cuban independence and modernization as the vanguard and custodian of cubiana.

Before 1959, Castro’s political ideas were more nationalistic and less radical than that of Raul and Che Guevara.

- Sebastian Balfour labelled them as unorthodox communists

While ‘socialism in one country’ in Cuba may have originated from discussions between the three in the Sierra, this was not shown in manifestos.

## 5.4 Why was Castro successful in his bid to overthrow Batista?

### Military and political factors

- Strength of commanders

- Che Guevara, Raul Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos

- Location on a rural part of the area

- population had been terrorized by Rural Guard (paramilitary police) for a long time

- hated central gov’t

- success of military offensives forced gov’t to divert troops to rural areas

- allows opposition to mobilize there

- Batista’s brutality and oppression

- increased opposition for Batista
- increased support for Castro

- Dissent with Batista’s army

By late 1950’s, Batista faced increasing popular opposition and armed resistance with an increasingly unreliable army.

### Economic developments

From 1952 to 1954, the price of sugar declined, causing recessions in Cuba.

The 1934 trade treaty with the US removed tariffs, so Cuban industry couldn’t develop (imports).

Resultant growing unemployment: 1957, 17% of labor force unemployed + 13% underemployed

### Role of the US

Late 1957, US decided that Batista should be replaced to protect US investments and prevent Castro’s rise to power.

March 1958, US placed arms embargo:

- weakens Batista’s hold on his military and civilian supporters
- resistance to Castro’s forces is more difficult

### Popular Support

Castro obtained increasing support.

Firstly, it was in rural areas. Rebels helped peasants buy food and harvest crops, while executing their persecutors. This support they gained helped them evade detection by Batista in the early stage of the war.

Then it spread to urban areas, as working class and student movements got involved in urban resistance, and middle-class and intellectuals supported.

THE SUCCESS OF CASTRO WAS TRUE INDEPENDENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 100 YEARS
