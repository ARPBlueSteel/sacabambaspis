Revolutions come and go, but regardless of the revolution and what country it takes place in, revolutions go through specific stages. Crane Brinton in his book, *Anatomy of a Revolution*, outlines "many" stages that all revolutions have in common. In an abbreviated form they include:

# 1. The accumulation of grievances and social restlessness of the masses over many years.

Revolutions are largely caused by economic reasons, although political events, social problems and ideology can lay a part as well. Although the economics of revolution are different every country, poverty and an unequal distribution of wealth lend themselves to revolution. Economic grievances take years to accumulate and with poverty comes social restlessness, strikes and protests, producing the demand for reform or revolution.

# 2. Hardening of the government's position with increased repression and conservatism.

As the demand for reforms increases, the government clamps down on individuals and groups within a society. The usual method is the restriction of civil rights, arrests and imprisonment of political dissidents combined with the elimination of democratic processes that could bring about progressive changes.

# 3. The emergence of moderate leaders combined with the lack of social and political reforms.

Moderate or liberal politicians emerge as compromise candidates with positive suggestions for reform, but because of the authoritarian governments in place, reasonable solutions are never allowed to transform society. With the elimination of moderate reformers, goes the last opportunity for reform

# 4. The triumph of radical leadership be it military dictatorship or ideological leadership.

As political and economic conditions deteriorate, leaders emerge who have radical solutions, both from the left or the right. Their solutions are simplistic, usually based on an ideology or on the cult of personality of an authoritarian leader or caudillo.

# 5. The symbolic historical revolutionary event, violent or non-violent, that caused a change over in government.

This is a major event of the revolution and it becomes the symbolic event of that revolution. In many cases, this symbolic event is usually more myth than fact. This event differs in every country, but usually involves a takeover of the government.

# 6. The implementation of revolutionary reforms as outlined by the new revolutionary party, based or not based on ideology.

Once the revolutionary party comes to power, the party begins to pass legislation to implement their political platform, with or without an ideology as a justification.

# 7. The acceptance of the revolution with no fear of foreign intervention or internal uprising.

Following the revolution and reforms, the revolution is accepted by the majority of people and the government is recognized by foreign powers. Without a strong internal opposition or fear of foreign intervention, the revolution is secure for the near future.

# 8. The growth of the counter revolution as the revolutionary process starts all over again with grievances of the masses. The revolution turns in on itself.

At this point, the revolution turns in on itself or has come full circle. The revolution becomes institutionalized and conservative in nature. The reforms are accepted, day to day politics overcomes ideology and the revolutionary party becomes very stable and self-serving. The grievances and social restlessness of those in opposition begins the process all over again.

# Conclusion

Crane Brinton in, Anatomy of Revolution, states that revolutions go through a series of stages with impending upheaval, widespread dissatisfaction, and culminating in riots, assassinations, and other acts of violence. The ruling group makes concessions, until the real transfer of power occurs. Reforms take place by the moderates, the moderates are unable to maintain control and the initiative passes to the extremists. Those out of power attempt to regain control and civil war results. The radicals are entrenched in power and they attempt to realize their utopian dreams. When their tenure has run its course, there is a return to normalcy which is called the Thermidorian Reaction.
