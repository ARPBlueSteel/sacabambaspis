Revolutions come and go, but regardless of the revolution and what country it takes place in, revolutions go through specific stages. Crane Brinton in his book, *Anatomy of a Revolution*, outlines "many" stages that all revolutions have in common. In an abbreviated form they include:

# 1. The accumulation of grievances and social restlessness of the masses over many years.

# 2. Hardening of the government's position with increased repression and conservatism.

# 3. The emergence of moderate leaders combined with the lack of social and political reforms.

# 4. The triumph of radical leadership be it military dictatorship or ideological leadership.

# 5. The symbolic historical revolutionary event, violent or non-violent, that caused a change over in government.

# 6. The implementation of revolutionary reforms as outlined by the new revolutionary party, based or not based on ideology.

# 7. The acceptance of the revolution with no fear of foreign intervention or internal uprising.

# 8. The growth of the counter revolution as the revolutionary process starts all over again with grievances of the masses. The revolution turns in on itself.
