# General

The agents for in any society (state) are the **revolutionaries**, the **reformers** and the military. Since the wars of independence in most South American countries, the military has played a significant role in development. The military form of government, however, is **costly to a country** in a number of ways:

1. The military **absorbed large portions** of the national budget which otherwise could be used for development.
2. **Officers made** far reaching **economic decisions** for nations which determined the extent of growth (or lack thereof)

In addition, the military has been a defender of the nation and public order. At the same time, been an alternate government, exercising real political power. The military, right or wrong, has **not enjoyed a savory reputation**. The most recent trend has been to connect the military to contraband trade (drug trafficking) or being associated with the American government.

By and large, the military has been associated with the **maintenance of the status quo** and served the **middle and upper classes**. Military governments have also been the **agent for change** and even provided **popular government**. Probably the best example is [[Argentina - Peron| Juan D. Peron]] of Argentina. Military government have made forms such as:

1. increased national autonomy
2. diversification of international trading partners & source of credit
3. more independent foreign policy
4. land reform
5. nationalized foreign business

Both Brazil and Peru seemed to offer the best examples of contrasting philosophies of change through the military. From 1964-85, Brazil had a growth rate of **10%** and was the worthy model of change. Some the other reforms of the military included:

1. Strengthened capitalistic institutions & highly centralized power, depoliticization of people
2. Approved foreign investments
3. Controlled inflation
4. Concentrated economic growth in consumer industries
5. Focused on industries and neglected agriculture

The biggest change that produced the "economic miracle" was in the areas of the **Southeast** and especially in **consumer/exported** goods. It was in the areas of **industrial reform** that caused problems in agriculture, producing dependence and disproportionate food prices. the Military in Brazil consumed itself with an increase in the GNP while at the same time, neglected social objectives. Despite Brazil's impressive growth rate, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. By 1974, the richest **10%** of the population absorbed **75%** of the wealth while the poorest **50%** got less than **10%** of the wealth. This is what the Generals referred to as the "economic miracle"

# Peru

In Peru the military  became the agents for social reform. Since the days of Pizarro, a small elite from **Europe** controlled the poor Indians. In fact, **1%** of the landowners controlled **80%** of the useable land. It was the military who became sensitive to the social, economic and political disparities of their own country. The world for the economic of Peru would be called **feudalism**. As a result, the military in October 1968 under General [[Military Dictatorship - General Juan Velasco Alvarado in Peru| Juan Velasco Alvarado]] deposed [[TN Peru's Leaders Belaunde Terry & Velasco Alvarado| President Fernando Belaunde Terry]]. Immediately, the military went about making "non-capitalist, non-communist" reforms. These included:

1. Transformed land structure **(Land Reform)**
2. Large/efficient estates were not broken up but run by workers as **cooperatives**
3. Invested millions in **rural infrastructure**
4. Initiated **large-scale irrigation projects** to bring barren lands/open Amazonians hinterlands under cultivation

The result was an increase yearly of 1.6% in the GNP from 1969-1974.

In areas other than the economy, the military emphasized Peru's Indian past, made **Quechua** the official language, and taught Indians history in the schools. These reforms were made in relative freedom without having to arrest the political opposition. The military, however, disbanded **former principal political parties** and did not have free democratic elections until 1980.

By September, 1975, General Velasco was replaced in a military coup because of his radical reforms. His accomplishments were:

1. Land reform
2. Reduction of the power of the traditional oligarchy
3. Nationalization of major resources
4. Expanded economic role of the state

Gradually the military lost their commitment to reform and in 1980, Fernando Belaunde Terry returned to power.

In returning to power, Fernando Belaunde Terry was faced with huge economic powers
