## Democracy in Crisis

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Implementation of Democracy|Reasons for Failure|
||Allende sworn in [4 September 1970] w/ 36% plurality – Popular Unity coalition. <br><br>- Immediate counteraction – General Schneider assassinated in Oct by the CIA under Nixon administration in the United States. <br>    <br>- 42% share of Congress – minority.<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Counteraction from Nixon continued – encouraged capital flights as well as took economic action against Allende. <br><br>- $8 million to truckers to continue financing their strike from CIA. <br>    <br>- $700k from US to fund El Mercurio, an anti-Allende newspaper. <br>    <br>- $1m+ to Patridad y Libertad, Fatherland and Liberty, a fascist Chilean party. <br>    <br>- Cut off loans from IADB, limited to $2m and also demanded payment for previous loans totaling hundreds of millions, almost impossible to pay back shortly. <br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Aimed to address “underdevelopment” – caused by dependence on foreign economies and international capitalism by nationalizing industry and land. <br><br>- Economic crises caused by short-term policies plays against him<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Redistribute income – increased real pay and price controls. <br><br>- Led to huge inflation as production lagged behind demand – high at 600%, which obscures the price control impact. <br>    <br>- 15% deficit first year of presidency. <br>    <br>- Quantity of money in circulation created bottlenecks in production. <br>    <br>- Strikes in 1972 (Pots), 1972 (Truckers), 1973 (Truckers and Miners). <br>    <br>- Furthered by lack of foreign loans – only $2m from IADB. <br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Socialist gov’t – could not decrease wages or increase taxes which increased problems. Retaliation from business class – capital flight and lockouts of workers. <br><br>- Expropriated “excess profits” from Anaconda, ITT and nationalized their holdings like copper and communications – created enemies.<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Followed the CD’s plans and expropriated land >80 hectares – inefficient as left most in conservative landowner hands and peasantry got minimal help. <br><br>- Still did more in 14 months than CD in 6 years. <br>    <br>- Peasantry did not cooperate – preferred own private land. <br>    <br>- Could not recoup money invested in rural infrastructure and reorganization. <br>    <br>- Revolutionary Left illegally seized land – divisions in the Left. <br>    <br>- Drained money that could be used elsewhere.<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Left divided in terms of means to the same ends – gradual or revolutionary?<br><br>  <br><br>[1972] Supply Committee to address food shortage concerns – placate the March of the Pots in the same year.<br><br>- Populist tactic – stopped by late-1972 trucker strikes.<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>[1973] Unified School System lost supp. of RCC – anti-religious education caused huge strikes and a state of emergency to be declared in 20 Chilean provinces. <br><br>  <br><br>[Post-1972] goodwill from Middle Class gone – Allende forced to make concessions to slow nationalization of small businesses, but Rev. Left undoes the goodwill gained. <br><br>- Appoints military to his cabinet – Gen. Carlos Prats as Minister of War 1973 to shore up support – Prats’ resignation Aug. 1973 → Pinochet added. <br>    <br>- Revolutionary Left and right-wing extremists in fights throughout 1973 – shows that Allende had lost control of situation in Chile. <br>    <br>- Military begins to ignore rightist militant groups; Pinochet throws coup Sept.|
