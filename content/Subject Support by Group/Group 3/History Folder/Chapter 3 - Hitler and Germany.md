## 3.11 What factors influenced domestic and social policy?

From 1933, Nazis set out to fulfill ideological aims and transform society. They wanted to change German behaviour and thinking through "Volksgemeinschaft” or national community, where every member of society worked to support others and contribute to the greater good of the nation, ‘Volk’.  

- one way of thinking, one way of life — the Nazi way

They didn’t want to destroy old class divisions but to subordinate them to new Nazi thinking. It perceived women in traditional roles, and was intolerant of alternative institutions such as the church.

The ‘Volk’ was to be made out of pure Aryans, forming a master race, where the state was superior to the individual. Nationalism and common world view would bring people together, allowing them to be committed to the goals of the state, and to expand and dominate.

The ideal German was a peasant farmer, dependent on German soil and living trad. German way of life. Nazis sought to eradicate social and racial outsiders, and therefore wanted to unite Aryan Germans against nationalist and anti-semitic goals.

This guided policy-making in the 1930s.

## 3.12 How successful was Nazi economic policy?

Hitler lacked a clear economic programme when becoming chancellor in 1933.

The 25-point programme of 1920 claimed to respond to needs of small farmers and urban traders, but this commitment didn't stay.

While Hitler sought to achieve power, he reassured big business to fund his campaigns.

There was token acknowledgement of socialist aspects in policies in early 1933:

- peasant debts (12 billion Reichsmarks) suspended from March to Oct. 1933
- high tariffs put on imported food
- Reich Food Estate gave peasant farmers guaranteed prices for produce
- Reich Entailed Farm Law (Sept. 1933) gave small farmers security of tenure by forbidding sale, confiscation, division, or mortgaging of small farms owned by Aryans
- Law for the Protection of Retail Trade (May 1933) helped small urban traders

- forbid new department stores

However, these measures took second place to the Nazis predominant desire to strengthen Germany for future war. Thus, the ‘national’ aspect was the main aspect behind economic policy. This produced Wehrwirtschaft, a defense economy that would provide for future war needs.

The principle became more important after 1936 w/ a ‘managed economy’ where the state regulated economic life. Wehrwirtschaft included autarky, which drove out socialism in favor of large-scale farms and rearmament. Thus from July 1933 to Dec 1936, over 1600 new cartel arrangements were made.

Historian Richard Grunberger estimated that only 40% of German production was owned by monopolies in 1933, but 70% in 1937. Many industrialists and companies became close to the regime, such as Krupp or I.G. Farben.

Hitler to building workers in May 1937 - “the decisive factor is not the theory but the performance of the economy,” meaning that no consistent approach was created, leading to ideological contradiction and conflict between private ownership and state direction.

Practical need to prove people with standard of living was difficult to balance with commitment to rearmament

- “guns and butter”

Unemployment peaked at 6 million (1/6th working popn.) in July 1932, and when Hitler became chancellor in 1933, exports were at 39% of the 1928 level. Nazis had to reduce unemployment, stimulate the economy, and address the balance of payments problem resulting from export market collapse.

Thus, March 1933, Hitler appointed Dr. Hjalmar Schacht as president of Reichsbank — a well respected non-Nazi.

July 1933, new law passed to reduce unemployment:

- government spending on public works schemes — Arbeitsdienst
- subsidies for private construction / renovation
- income tax rebates/loans to encourage industrial activity

  
Other measures:

- emergency relief schemes
- recruitment in Reich Labor Service 1934, sending unemployed to work on civil, military, agricultural projects
- law of construction of 7000 km motorway — the Autobahnen
- specific regulations. such as no machinery for road building to allow for labor
- expansion of party and national bureaucracy
- discouragement of female labor
- March 1935, conscription and increased rearmament

Tax concessions were offered to businesses, and Schacht raised money for investment through ‘mefo bills’:

- credit notes by the Reichsbank and backed by the gov’t
- a form of deficit financing
- paid back with interest after 5 years with tax revenue that they would generate
- repayments on mefo bills accounted for 50% of gov’t spending in 1934-35

Mefo bills permitted subsidies and agreements matching private investment in the car industry. This stimulated housing, road construction, the rearmament industry, etc.

Schacht took action to erode Germany’s debt and improve balance of payments:

- 1933, controls to limit drain of Germany’s foreign exchange by paying foreign debts in Reichsmarks

July 1934, debt repayment was stopped and creditors were given bonds. Although this was opposed, they failed to pressure Germany. Thus, the Nazis pushed forth with the New Plan in Sept. 1934, devised by Schacht, who became the minister of economics.

The New Plan aims:

- increased gov’t regulation of imports
- development of trade with less-developed countries
- development of Germany trade with central and south-east Europe

The New Plan execution:

- series of trade agreements with Balkan and South American states giving import of vital raw materials

- paid in Reichsmarks to encourage foreign purchase of German goods

Other influenced that revived the economy:

- avoidance of labor troubles via dissolution of trade unions
- banning of strikes
- creation of DAF in May 1933
- use of propaganda to increase illusion of success & prosperity
- ‘windfalls’:

- seizure of Jewish and Austrian assets
- Anschluss 1938

### Did the Nazis perform an ‘economic miracle’?

Unemployment fell from 6 million to 2.5 million in 18 months of Hitler coming to power.

1936 — 1.6 million

1939 — under 200,000

Economic investment increased and public expenditure:

- 17.1 billion in 1932
- 18.4 billion in 1933
- 23.6 billion Reichsmarks in 1939

Despite Hitler talking about new ‘determination’, the economic situation when he took office wasn’t as bad as he suggested. Reparations had ended and unemployment was already beginning to fall with the est. of work creation schemes. The world economic recovery from late 1932 laid the basis for the Nazi miracle.

Further, Nazi policies were not a total success:

- foreign currency reserves stayed low
- balance of payments continued to be in deficit
- after 1936, grew worse as Schacht’s influence declined
- rearmament strained economy
- real wages increased but price of food rose

Despite Nazi claims, economic policies were not thought through, so the economic miracle was not due to Nazi work.

### How ready was Germany for war in 1939?

By 1936, Schacht was urging for less public expenditure and slower rearmament as it strained the balance of payments. Hitler disagreed, and Aug. 1936 the Four-Year Plan was announced with Hermann Goering directing it.

Four-Year Plan (1936):

- emphasis on autarky

- plants to build substitute synthetic materials such as artificial rubber

- encouragement to chemical industry and development of synthetic fuel
- development of steelworks using lower-grade German ore
- emphasis on production of heavy machinery
- office of Four-Year Plan regulates foreign exchange, labor, raw material distribution and prices
- targets for private industry est. through 6 sub-offices controlling production & distribution:

- raw materials
- labour force
- agriculture
- price control
- foreign exchange
- ReichswerekeHermann Goering (steel plant)

The plan extended Nazi control by setting up a ‘managed’ economy by cooperating with big business.

Private industry continued but failure to meet expectations would result in takeovers.

The plan had success with growth in production in all areas, but overall targets were not met and synthetic production was too expensive.

1939, Germany imported 1/3rd of raw materials (iron ore, oil, rubber) and shortage of foreign exchange reserves stayed

The plan was impeded by bureaucratic inefficiency and internal rivalry while the need to maintain consumer good production for German people impeded priorities.

Marxist Historian Tim Mason argues that the German economy was in crisis by 1938, which drove Germany to war. The economy was under strain from rearmament, but they couldn’t make sacrifices such as wage reductions. The conflict between ‘guns and butter’ also threatened unrest in working classes, so Hitler had to go to war early.

Historian Overy argues that the decision to go to war caused the economic crisis, and the decision was decided by ending appeasement.

Most historians agree regardless that Germany was not ready for war in 1939:

- Taylor — Hitler was unable to focus on rearmament due to consumer production
- Burton Klein — ready for short Blitzkrieg but not total war

- modest scale of economic mobilization in 1939 and 30% rise in production of consumer goods from 1936-39

- Overy — Hitler was preparing but not ready

- speech at Hossbach Conference Nov. 1937 — Hitler argued BR and FR wouldn’t fight for Czech independence and Poland could be taken without war

- Nazi-Soviet Pact 1939 (deal with Stalin to divide Poland) demonstrates Hitler wanted to get Poland peacefully to use its resources before launching war later

- due to failure of peaceful expansion in Sept. 1939, Hitler told Goering he wanted “complete conversion of economy to wartime requirements” causing dates to be brought forward

### Speer’s Management of Wartime Economy

Nazi rearmament programs were only halfway complete when war broke out.
