### Historical Debate
- Argentine historian Tulio Halperin Donghi points out *difficulty* in defining caudillos
	- went beyond stereotypical role of military or paramilitary leader merely seeking to obtain power by force rather than democratic means
- Italian political scientist Federica Morelli pointed to new definition of caudillos
	- **Traditional view:** power-hungry traitors to the cause of democracy (prevalent through late 19th and early 20th century, North American and European historians)
	- **Revisionist view:** developed modern political policies alongside traditional conservative roles
- Revisionist perspective focuses **on community-based grassroots political practices** that contributed towards nation building
	- petitions, local revolts
	- lawyers and jurists working to construct laws for states
		- formed core of political elites and influenced public opinion
	- social actors contributed to nation building from salons, literary circles, political clubs, etc.

### Origin of Caudillos
- emerged from liberal and conservative camps, representing grievances of different interest groups
	- ranchers, farmers, merchants, landowners, mine owners, etc.
	- sometimes represented lower classes and indigenous folks
- had mixed origins:
	- Rafael Carrera of Guatemala, **humble origins**
	- Jose Antonia Paez of Venezuela, **mixed racial** and social origins
	- Martin Miguel de Guemes of Northern Argentina, **indigenous**
	- etc.
- **peons** or former soldiers of independence armies became military support for early caudillos
	- caudillos being successful and popular officers of the wars of independence
	- were charismatic and could employ military justice to maintain authority and eliminate opponents
- caudillos could also come to power through liberal—conservative hostility
	- ex. Rafael Carrera of Guatemala
		- through conflict between the Church and the liberal government, gained power from powerful municipalities and rose to power
- caudillos didn't always become President
	- ex. Businessman Diego Portales of Chile in the 1930s
		- formed powerful conservative influence groups as Minister, then used influence to push for his ideas of strong systems of law and order

### Role of Caudillos
- important nation-builders in L.A. politics from 1820 to 1870s
	- but not the only social actors demanding/suppressing change
- ex. in newly independent Kingdom of Brazil (source Brazilian historian Jurandir Malerba)
	- strong conservative elite groups exerted power to maintain privilege, monopoly, and institution of slavery
	- occasionally supported local strongmen—caudillos
- difficult to dismiss caudillos as stereotypical crude despots
	- ex. Juan Manuel de Rosas of Argentina
		- ruled for 23 years as a tyrant, refusing to build republican institutions or a constitution
		- however, never touched public funds and lived modestly
		- a conservative landowner in Argentina ruling with an iron hand, supported by the RCC and curtailed free speech and ideas
		- 1835, announced new customs law to protect agriculture, ranchers, and manufacturing industry
			- benefiting the middle class and urban lower class
		- wary against Native American population
			- ex. 1852, when offered support against army that would unseat him, thought that the indigenous people would get too much power and revolt
