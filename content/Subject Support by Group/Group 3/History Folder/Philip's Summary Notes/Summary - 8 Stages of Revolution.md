According to Crane Brinton in the book *Anatomy of a Revolution*, all revolutions must have some of the following 8 stages.
### 1. Accumulation of Grievances Over Many Years
- are largely caused by economic reasons, although political events and social problems/ideologies can play a part
	- commonly poverty and unequal distribution of wealth
- economic grievances take years to accumulate and with poverty comes social restlessness, strikes and protests, producing the demand for reform or revolution
### 2. Hardening of Government's Position
- as demand for reform increases, government clamps down on individuals and groups in society
- this is typically done through:
	- restriction of civil rights
	- arrests and imprisonment of political dissidents
	- elimination of democratic processes that could bring progressive changes
### 3. Emergence of Moderate Leaders Combined with Lack of Social and Political Reforms
- moderate/liberal politicians emerge as compromise candidates with positive suggestions for reform
- authoritarian governments prevent reasonable solutions from succeeding
- with moderate reformers eliminated, reform is no longer achievable
### 4. Triumph of Radical Leadership, be it Military or Ideological Leadership 
- as political and economic conditions deteriorate, leaders emerge with radical solutions from both the left and right
- these solutions are simplisticâ€”based on ideology or cult of personality of authoritarian leaders or caudillo
### 5. Symbolic Historical Revolutionary Event, Violent or Non-violent, that Caused Change over Government
- major event of revolution, becoming a symbolic event of that revolution
- in many cases, symbolic event is usually more myth than fact
- event differs in every country, but usually involves a takeover of the government
### 6. Implementation of Revolutionary Reforms as Outlined by the New Revolutionary Party Based/Not Based on Ideology
- once the revolutionary party comes to power, the party begins to pass legislation to implement their political platform
- may or may not use an ideology as justification
### 7. Acceptance of Revolution with No Fear of Foreign Intervention or Internal Uprisings
- following revolution and reforms, the revolution is accepted by the majority of people 
- government is recognized by foreign powers
- without strong internal opposition or fear of foreign intervention, the revolution is secure for the near future
### 8. Growth of Counter Revolution as the Revolutionary Process Starts All Over Again 
- the revolution turns in on itself, coming full circle
- revolution becomes institutionalized and conservative in nature
- reforms are accepted, day-to-day politics overcome ideology and the revolutionary party becomes stable and self serving
- grievances and restlessness of opposition begins the process all over
### Conclusion
- revolutions go through a series of stages with impending upheaval, widespread dissatisfaction, and culminating in riots, assassinations, other violence
- ruling group makes concessions, until real transfer of power occurs
- reforms take place by moderates, moderates are unable to maintain control, and initiatives passes to extremists
- those out of power attempt to regain control, resulting in civil war
- radicals gain power and attempt to realize utopian dreams
