The paradox of military dictatorships that [[TN Peru's Leaders Belaunde Terry & Velasco Alvarado#^329933|Fernando Belaunde Terry]] proposed doesn't, really apply to the dictatorship of General Juan Velasco Alvarado in Peru. His regime was certainly reformist, but it only maintained stability and order for a short time. Furthermore, there was a relative lack of repression and abuse of human rights.

Alvarado's left-wing government brought about many reforms, especially in the
areas of land, foreign investments, and education. Under the Agrarian Law of 1969,
haciendas larger than 375 acres were expropriated and put in the hands of government-
directed collectives, individuals, or Indian communes. Rural infrastructure was financed.
Large-scale irrigation projects were carried out to make arid land farmable, as there wasn't
enough for the many landless peasants. In terms of foreign investments, the junta of
Alvarado embarked on a program of economic nationalism. It nationalised American petroleum, copper and sugar companies, as well as the fish meal industry and mining
industries. The government also insisted that the majority of foreign companies' stock be
held by nationals. In education, a reform bill was passed in 1972 which featured the
recognition of the equality of women, the establishment of rural schools, the granting of
autonomy to universities, and the use of the Indian Quechua or Aymara languages in
schools (which was part of a movement to emphasize Peru's Indian heritage).

Peru's reforms led to only temporary economic stability. There was a gradual rise in
production from 1969 to 1974. However, the land reforms were too radical and backfired
in the end. The hopes of becoming a major oil exporter were unfulfilled; the reserves were
overestimated, which resulted in the fact that the large sums of money being pumped into
the project almost] brought the country to bankruptcy. Also, the disappearance of anchovies
in 1972 brought down fish exports. Foreign loans obtained for the agrarian reforms and
large copper and oil projects increased the national debt.

Politically, Peru was also not as stable as most military dictatorships. Upon coming
to power, Alvarado had imprisoned opposing politicians and suspended constitutional
liberties. He disbanded other important political parties, and held no elections throughout
his entire rule. He also censored the press, closed some radio stations and newspapers, and
acquired control of some privately owned television stations. However, there wasn't much actual repression and abuse of human rights, and political opposition did exist, often objecting to the government's policies. The relatively premature end of Alvarado's
dictatorship when he was replaced by a new junta, is also a sign of the relative instability of
his regime.

As mentioned, Alvarado's government wasn't very repressive, nor did it generally
abuse human rights. There weren't many cases of torture or execution. Asides from some political intolerance and its censorship of the media, there was little actual repression and
human rights were generally maintained. In fact, the land reform and other socialist
reforms actually attempted to raise the standards of life of the average Peruvian. Alvarado
was sympathetic to the people, and therefore treated them relatively well.

Thus, Alvarado's government is not an example of Belaunde's paradox. It is true that
he was very reformist, but his dictatorship was not very stable and orderly, and repression
and abuse of basic human rights were generally absent during his regime.
