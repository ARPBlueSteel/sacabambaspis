Theory of Knowledge questions/connections:  Scientists investigate the world at different scales; the macroscopic and microscopic. Which ways of knowing allow us to move from the macroscopic to the microscopic?  The career of Fritz Haber coincided with the political upheavals of two world wars.

How does the social context of scientific work affect the methods and findings of science? Should scientists be held morally responsible for the applications of their discoveries?  We can use mathematics successfully to model equilibrium systems. Is this because we create mathematics to mirror reality or because the reality is intrinsically mathematical? Equilibrium-1 Introduction to Equilibrium So far in this course, we have concerned ourselves primarily with chemical reactions that go basically to completion. For example, hydrocarbon fuels will burn in the presence of excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, leaving virtually none of the fuel behind. However, many chemical reactions do not go to completion because a reverse reaction is simultaneously competing with the forward reaction. These reactions will eventually reach a state of chemical (dynamic) equilibrium, which we explore in this unit of study. Consider the following equilibrium system: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) Two reactions are happening simultaneously: ▪ Nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas are reacting to form ammonia (the forward reaction) ▪ Ammonia is decomposing to form nitrogen and hydrogen gases (the reverse reaction) Definition: A chemical system is said to be in dynamic equilibrium when: ➢ Substances continue to change from products to reactants and vice versa, but the forward and reverse rates are equal. ➢ The amounts (concentrations) of reactants and products are constant. Examples of physical equilibrium systems: a glass of ice water a bottle of water a bottle of soda water Examples of chemical equilibrium systems: The ozone-oxygen equilibrium in the atmosphere: 3O2(g) ⇌ 2O3(g) Vinegar (a weak acid) solution: CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ H3O+ (aq) + CH3COO–(aq) Oxygen transport in the human body (by a protein called hemoglobin): Equilibrium-2 In class, we used a macro-level analogy to introduce the concept of dynamic equilibrium. The setup included two large beakers to contain the water and two smaller beakers to transfer the water between the two large beakers: ▪ Beakers A and B represent… ▪ Beakers X and Y represent… Case 1: Start with Beaker A full, Beaker B empty. Beaker X is larger than Beaker Y. (analogous to initial conditions where only reactants are present, no products) Case 2: Start with Beaker A empty, but Beaker B full instead. (analogous to initial conditions where only products are present, no reactants) Fundamental features of chemical (dynamic) equilibria: ➢ Dynamic equilibria can only be established in a closed system. There can be no transfer of material (mass) or energy to or from the surroundings. ➢ At equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are constant. ➢ At equilibrium, particles continue to react in both the forward and reverse directions. ➢ At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. ➢ The same equilibrium position will be reached independent of the initial concentrations of the reactants and products (the “starting conditions”). A B X Y fwd rxn rev rxn [ ] time rate time [ ] time rate time Equilibrium-3 The Equilibrium Law Recall from the previous section that when a chemical system is at equilibrium, reactant and product concentrations are constant. Experimentally, chemists have discovered a mathematical relationship between the concentrations of products and reactants at equilibrium, called the equilibrium law: For the general equilibrium: aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD IMPORTANT NOTE: Kc is only constant for a given temperature. If the temperature changes, so does Kc (more on that later!) The magnitude of Kc gives an indication of the equilibrium position: Let’s practice writing expressions for Kc (called equilibrium expressions): 2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g) Fe3+ (aq) + SCN–(aq) ⇌ FeSCN 2+ (aq) N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) CH4(g) + 2O2(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) CaCO3(s) ⇌ Ca2+ (aq) + CO3 2–(aq) Cu(s) + 2Ag+ (aq) ⇌ Cu 2+ (aq) + 2Ag(s) The first four examples are homogeneous equilibria (all species in the same phase); the second two are heterogeneous equilibria (two or more different phases present). In heterogeneous equilibria, solids do not appear in the equilibrium expression (neither do pure liquids) because their activities (see below) are equal to exactly one, and hence cancel out of the expression. Although the Kc expression contains concentration values (units: mol dm-3), Kc is usually calculated as a unitless value. Strictly speaking, equilibrium constants are computed from a unitless property called activity, not concentration. However, activity and concentration are more or less equal for gases and dilute solutions, so in these cases using concentration to calculate Kc is a fair approximation. When an equilibrium constant is calculated using activities, it is simply symbolized K (or Keq). 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 very small very large Equilibrium-4 eqm eqm eqm eqm Consider these two equilibria: H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) Kc = 0.35 at 500ºC H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌ 2HCl(g) Kc = 4400 at 500ºC These are similar chemical systems, but with very different values for Kc. What conclusions can we draw from these data? When reactions are inverses or multiples of one another, the values of Kc are related mathematically. Consider these three different representation of the same equilibrium at 500ºC: 1) H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌ 2HCl(g) Kc,1 = [𝐻𝐶𝑙]2 [𝐻2][𝐶𝑙2] = 4400 2) 2HCl(g) ⇌ H2(g) + Cl2(g) Kc,2 = 3) ½H2(g) + ½Cl2(g) ⇌ HCl(g) Kc,3 = The “reaction quotient”, Q: Recall that the concentrations in the Kc expression are equilibrium values. As such, we could more accurately represent the Kc expression thusly: However, there are times when it is useful for a chemist to know the numerical value for this expression under non-equilibrium conditions. In these cases, the ratio is termed the reaction quotient: Calculating the reaction quotient can help a chemist determine if a particular system is at equilibrium and if not, in which direction the system will react or “shift” in order to reach equilibrium. For example, say a chemist is analyzing the equilibrium from equation (1) above and finds that at 500ºC, [H2] = [Cl2] = 0.10 M and [HCl] = 2.0 M. What conclusions can she draw? Comparing the value of Q to the value of Kc can help us predict shift direction: ▪ If Q < Kc… ▪ If Q > Kc… Q Equilibrium-5 Practice Problems: The Equilibrium Law 1.

What can we conclude about the value of Kc for a typical combustion reaction? Why? 8. State at least one experimental condition necessary before equilibrium can be achieved. Equilibrium-6 Le Châtelier’s Principle We previously explored chemical systems moving toward a position of equilibrium. Now we explore how chemical systems at equilibrium respond when they are disturbed by external changes. Le Châtelier’s Principle states that if a closed system at equilibrium is subjected to a change, the system will respond by shifting in one direction to counteract that change. Consider the Haber process: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) ΔH = –92 kJ Let’s see how this principle applies to a variety of changes (“stresses” or “disruptions”): 1. Changes in concentration (by addition or removal of one species) ➢ If the concentration of one species is an equilibrium is increased, the equilibrium will respond by shifting away from the addition. ➢ If the concentration of one species is an equilibrium is decreased, the equilibrium will respond by shifting toward the removal. Example: The N2/H2/NH3 system above is initially at equilibrium in a 1.0 L glass bulb when some additional hydrogen gas is suddenly injected into the system: 2. Changes in temperature ➢ If the temperature of an equilibrium system is increased, the equilibrium will respond by shifting in the endothermic direction. ➢ If the temperature of an equilibrium system is decreased, the equilibrium will respond by shifting in the exothermic direction. Example: The N2/H2/NH3 system above is at equilibrium when the temperature is increased. [ ] time [H2] [N2] [NH3] Q time rate time [ ] time [H2] [N2] [NH3] Q time rate time Equilibrium-7 3. Changes in pressure: ➢ If the pressure on an equilibrium system is increased, the equilibrium will respond by shifting toward the side with fewer gas particles (fewer moles of gas). ➢ If the pressure on an equilibrium system is decreased, the equilibrium will respond by shifting toward the side with the greater number of gas particles (more moles of gas). Example: The N2/H2/NH3 system above is at equilibrium when the pressure is increased. 4. Adding a catalyst Recall that catalysts increase the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy, allowing a greater fraction of particles to exceed the minimum kinetic energy required to react. ⇌ ⇌ [ ] time [H2] [N2] [NH3] Q time rate time Equilibrium-8 Practice Problems: Le Châtelier’s Principle 1. Consider the equilibrium: 184 kJ + 2HCl(g) ⇌ H2(g) + Cl2(g) In which direction would the equilibrium shift in the event of the following disruptions? a) Increasing the temperature b) Injecting some HCl(g) c) Increasing the pressure d) Adding some Fe(s), which reacts with only the H2(g) 2. Consider the equilibrium: 2H2(g) + 2NO(g) ⇌ N2(g) + 2H2O(g) ΔHrxn = –84 kJ In which direction would the equilibrium shift in the event of the following disruptions? a) Decreasing the temperature b) Increasing the volume of the container c) Injecting nitrogen monoxide gas d) Removing some water vapour via condensation e) Compare and contrast the equilibrium response when argon (an inert gas) is added to this equilibrium when it is contained in a glass flask versus in an expandable balloon. 3. For each disruption from #1 and #2, deduce: i) The instantaneous change to Q (up, down or none) upon the disruption ii) The change in Q (up, down or none) during the equilibrium shift iii) The value of Kc after the disruption, compared to the initial Kc (greater, less, same) 4. Consider the equilibrium: 2CO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2CO2(g) ΔHrxn = +566 kJ Describe the net effect on Q and the concentration of carbon dioxide for each of the following disruptions on this system, assuming it was initially at equilibrium: a) Increasing the temperature b) Injecting some oxygen gas c) Decreasing the pressure d) Injecting some carbon monoxide gas e) Injecting some carbon dioxide gas 5. Consider the equilibrium: 2NO2(g) ⇌ N2O4(g) At 150ºC, the equilibrium constant is 5.0×10-5. At 25ºC, the equilibrium constant is 2.5×10-3. Deduce the sign of ΔH and rationalize it using principles of chemical bonding and structure. 6. At a particular temperature, Kc for the Haber Process equilibrium we worked with on pp. 7-8 is known to be 125. The temperature is then changed and the new Kc is calculated to be 32. Is this new temperature higher or lower than the initial temperature? How do you know? Answer questions #7-9 on the [ ]/Q/rate graph templates provided. Choose arbitrary initial values for the concentrations of each species, Kc and rates, then plot the effects of each disruption. Assume that each system is initially at equilibrium and takes three minutes to return to equilibrium after each disruption. 7. Consider the equilibrium: 3O2(g) ⇌ 2O3(g) ΔHrxn = +286 kJ a) At t = 5 min, some oxygen gas is injected b) At t = 10 min, temperature is decreased c) At t = 15 min, a copper plate is introduced to the system, which reacts with the ozone only 8. Consider the equilibrium: 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g) ΔHrxn = –197 kJ a) At t = 5 min, temperature is increased b) At t = 10 min, some SO2 is injected c) At t = 15 min, the pressure is increased by decreasing the volume of the container 9. Consider the equilibrium: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) ΔH = –92 kJ a) At t = 5 min, pressure is decreased b) At t = 10 min, temperature is increased c) At t = 15 min, a condenser is introduced to the system, removing only ammonia Equilibrium-9 Industrial application: The Haber Process The Haber Process is one equilibrium of particular significance that we will study in detail: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) ΔH = –92 kJ/mol Between 1886 and 1911, Fritz Haber developed a process for the direct combination of nitrogen and hydrogen gases over an iron catalyst to produce ammonia. Large quantities of ammonia were needed at the time for two main applications: ▪ Bombs: Ammonia was used to produce nitric acid (HNO3), a key chemical in the manufacture of munitions (bombs, ammunition, other weapons) ▪ Bread: Ammonia is a key fertilizer; applying ammonia to soil improves crop yields. During WWI, Germany’s main supply of ammonia was from mining efforts in Chile, but the Allies blockaded German ships and cut off the supply, crippling production of German munitions and food. It is estimated that billions are alive today because Haber found a way to transform relatively inert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (“bread from the air”), but that tens of millions have died as a direct result of explosives created from Haber-manufactured ingredients. Talk about a complicated legacy! Let’s now explore the chemistry of the Haber process: According to Le Chatelier’s Principle, which temperature and pressure conditions will result in the highest yield of ammonia? In practice, these temperature and pressure conditions are not used. Why? ➢ The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature near 500ºC (~800 K). ➢ The pressure in the reaction vessel is typically close to 200 atm. 200 400 600 800 1000 Equilibrium-10 Environmental application: The ozone-oxygen equilibrium Most of the ozone in Earth’s atmosphere exists in the layer known as the stratosphere (15-50 km above Earth’s surface). Stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Without ozone, the Sun’s intense UV radiation would sterilize the Earth’s surface. Ozone is formed due to the photoreaction of molecular oxygen. When an O2 molecule absorbs a photon of light (hν), it dissociates into highly reactive, monoatomic oxygen. These O atoms then immediately react with another O2 molecule to form ozone: O2 + hν → O + O O2 + O → O3 Ozone is also destroyed by a photoreaction. The absorption of ultraviolet light breaks an O–O bond in the ozone molecule, generating O2 and a highly reactive oxygen atom, which reacts with another ozone molecule to produce two more O2 molecules: O3 + hν → O + O2 O3 + O → O2 + O2 Because of these competing chemical processes, an equilibrium is established between oxygen and ozone in our atmosphere: In the kinetics unit, we explored how NO catalyzes ozone depletion via a three-step mechanism (p. 14). Ozone depletion can also be catalyzed by chlorine radicals released from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) after they undergo homolytic fission: In the mid-20 th century, CFCs were in common use as refrigerants and fire-fighting materials. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that atmospheric ozone concentrations were in rapid decline and showed that CFCs were largely responsible. By 1987, many nations had signed a treaty called the Montreal Protocol, which severly limited CFC use and production. UV light from the Sun is classified into three groups, according to their relative energies: UV-A: 400-315 nm UV-B: 315-280 nm UV-C: 100-280 nm Answer the following questions to explore how the ozone-oxygen equilibrium in the Earth’s atmosphere plays a key role in the absorption of UV light from the Sun: 1. Draw Lewis structures for the oxygen and ozone molecules. Which of the two molecules exhibits resonance? State the O–O bond order in each molecule. 2. Compare and contrast the bond strengths and bond lengths in oxygen versus ozone. 3. The average bond enthalpy for the oxygen-oxygen bond in O2 is given in the Data Booklet in units of kJ mol-1. Calculate this bond enthalpy in units of Joules per bond. 4. Using your answer from #4, calculate the maximum wavelength of the photon that has enough energy to cleave (break) the oxygen-oxygen bond in O2. 5. The bond enthalpy for the oxygen-oxygen bond in ozone is 380 kJ mol-1. Repeat #3 and #4 for the oxygen-oxygen bond in ozone to deduce the maximum wavelength of light that they absorb. 6. Which class(es) of UV light (A, B, C) are most effectively absorbed by oxygen? By ozone? 7. Explain which class of UV light is the most energetic and hence, most dangerous to human health. 8. Peak concentrations of about 8 ppm (8 ozone molecules per million total atmospheric molecules) occur about 25km above the Earth’s surface. What can we conclude about the value of Kc for the ozone-oxygen equilibrium (as written in the box, above-right)? 3O2(g) ⇌ 2O3(g) e.g. CCl2F2 → Cl• + •CClF2 Cl• + O3 → ClO• + O2 ClO• + O → Cl• + O2 O3 + O → O2 Equilibrium-11 Equilibrium (Kc) Calculations Previously, we explored how Le Châtelier’s Principle can be applied to predict shift direction in the event of changes in concentration, temperature or pressure. Now, we will learn how the equilibrium law can be applied to quantify the effects of such changes. Recall the Haber Process for producing ammonia: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) + 92 kJ Example 1: At 100ºC, a 5.0 L flask contains 1.0 mol of N2(g), 2.5 mol of H2(g), and 12 mol of NH3(g) in a state of chemical equilibrium. Calculate Kc. Example 2: 5.0 mol of ammonia were added to an empty 10.0 L bulb and the system was allowed to reach equilibrium at 250ºC. The equilibrium concentration of H2(g) was 0.36 M. Calculate Kc. N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇌ 2NH3 (g) I (initial) S (shift) E (equil.) Example 3: Some NH3(g) was introduced to an empty 1.0 L flask. After the system reached equilibrium at 600ºC, 0.40 mol of N2(g) were present. If Kc = 0.0072, how many moles of NH3(g) were added initially? N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) ⇌ 2NH3 (g) I (initial) S (shift) E (equil.) How can Kc be different for Examples 1-3 if we are examining the same equilibrium system? Example 4: For the equilibrium below, Kc = 42 at 275ºC. If 1.0 mol of CO2 and 1.0 mol of H2 are injected into an initially empty 1.0 L flask and the system is allowed to reach equilibrium, calculate the concentrations of all species once equilibrium is reached. CO(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2 (g) I (initial) S (shift) E (equil.) Equilibrium-12 Example 5: At a temperature of 225ºC, Kc = 133 for the equilibrium below. If 5.0 mol of CO2, 5.0 mol of H2, 1.0 mol of H2O and 1.0 mol of CO are injected into a 1.00 L flask at 75ºC, in which direction will the equilibrium shift? Determine the equilibrium concentrations of each species. CO(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2 (g) I (initial) S (shift) E (equil.) Considering data from Examples 4 and 5, deduce whether the equilibrium is exothermic or endothermic as written. Calculate G at both temperatures (225ºC and 275ºC) and comment on the differences between the two values. Flip ahead a page or two for help! Example 6: At a different temperature, the same system reached equilibrium in a 1.0 L flask and was found to contain 2.0 mol of CO, 2.0 mol of H2O, 1.0 mol of CO2 and 1.0 mol of H2. If 1.0 mol of CO was injected into this system, determine the amount of H2 present after equilibrium re-establishes. CO(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2 (g) I (initial) S (shift) E (equil.) Equilibrium-13 The Equilibrium Constant (Kc) and Spontaneity (Gº) Recall that the Gibbs free energy change (Gº) determines whether or not a reaction is spontaneous. The Gibbs free energy change is related to the equilibrium constant by van’t Hoff’s equation: Gº = –RT lnK Let’s examine this mathematical relationship in broad terms: ➢ When K is greater than 1… ➢ When K is less than 1… Consider the Haber Process (p. 9): N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) ΔGº = –33 kJ/mol ➢ The overall Gibbs free energy (G) of a system depends on how much of each substance is present. ➢ The equilibrium mixture represents the composition of reactants and products that gives a minimum value of the Gibbs free energy. Practice: 1. For the equilibrium PCl3(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌ PCl5(g) at 275ºC, G = –99 kJ mol-1. Calculate Kc at this temperature. 2. Using data from Table 12 of the Data Booklet and Sº(H2) = 131 J mol-1 K -1, calculate ΔHº, ΔSº and ΔGº for the equilibrium system CH4(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO(g) + 3H2(g). Calculate Kc and comment on its magnitude. 3. Predict the signs of ΔHº and ΔSº for the equilibrium system N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g), explaining your reasoning for each. Then, predict and explain the effect of increasing temperature on ΔGº and Kc. 4. At 450ºC, Kc = 2.4×104 for the equilibrium 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g). Given ΔS = –189 J mol-1 K -1, calculate ΔG and ΔH at this temperature. 1. 2.7×109; 2. ΔHº = 205 kJ mol-1, ΔSº = 216 J mol-1 K-1, ΔGº = 141 kJ mol-1, Kc = 2.0×10-25; 3. ΔHº > 0, ΔSº > 0. Increasing T causes a decrease in ΔG and an increase in Kc; 4. ΔG = –61 kJ mol-1, ΔH = +76 kJ mol-1. Equilibrium-14 Equilibrium Calculations – Practice 1.
