# This Site

This site is intended to be a successor to the [rhsibresources](https://rhsibresources.wixsite.com/bettergrind) (pass:`castrolikesC0WS`) site. This is intended to be a continuous project where students build upon the success (and failure) of other students to help others achieve more.

This site differs from other resource repositories in that it is intended to be accessible to all RHS IB students as a crystallization of our collective knowledge. In essence, it is a digital garden of information maintained by IB student for IB students.

We believe that the difference between a good IB student and a great IB student is the resources they have access to. Therefore, the sites contributors hopes to empower every IB student to be great.

For the more technical people out there, this is generated using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). Quartz is a static generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Curators of this site typically use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit the MarkDown files in site.
