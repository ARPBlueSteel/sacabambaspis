# This Site

This site is intended to be a successor to the [rhsibresources](https://rhsibresources.wixsite.com/bettergrind) (pass:`castrolikesC0WS`) site. This is intended to be a continuous project where students build upon the success (and failure) of other students to help others achieve more.

## Contributing Resources

This site relies upon the work of IB students at RHS to keep the resources at this site up to date. We at Project Sacabambaspis appreciate all types of resources, including but not limited to:

- Notes (paper or digital notes)
- Flashcards (quizlet, anki)
- EE, IA, TOK Essay/Exhibition exemplars

If you have resources regarding IB please contact **Ethan Yu** (arpbluesteel) on discord.

>[!warning]
>Do not send us copyrighted content such as past papers and textbooks. This site runs the risk of getting taken down by GitHub if the holder decides to strike it. There are plenty of places on the internet to find this sort of stuff.
## Paying US

We literally do this for free and for the benefit of RHS students. As such, it would be nice once in a while for people to buy us a coffee or something and give us some hope in human decency. In addition, if you actually pay us enough we'll buy a real domain for this.
