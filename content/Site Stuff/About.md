# This Site

This site is intended to be a successor to the [rhsibresources](https://rhsibresources.wixsite.com/bettergrind) (pass:`castrolikesC0WS`) site. This is intended to be a continuous project where students build upon the success (and failure) of other students to help others achieve more.

This site differs from other resource repositories in that it is intended to be accessible to all RHS IB students as a crystallization of our collective knowledge. In essence, it is a digital garden of information maintained by IB student for IB students. As such

## Contributing Resources

This site relies upon the work of IB students at RHS to keep the resources at this site up to date. We here at [[index|Project Sacabambaspis]] appreciate all types of resources, including but not limited to:

- Notes (paper or digital notes)
- Flashcards (quizlet, anki)
- EE, IA, TOK Essay/Exhibition exemplars

If you have resources regarding IB please contact **Ethan Yu** (arpbluesteel) on discord.

>[!warning]
>Do not send us copyrighted content such as past papers and textbooks. This site runs the risk of getting taken down by GitHub if the holder decides to strike it. There are plenty of places on the internet to find this sort of stuff and chances are your friends already know about this.

## Curation/Writing

This site relies on the maintenance of IB students past present and future. Therefore, it is important that future students also become curators and maintainers of this digital garden.
