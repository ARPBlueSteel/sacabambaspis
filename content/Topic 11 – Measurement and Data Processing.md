### **Big ideas:** 
> - [ ] All measured values must be expressed with appropriate units in order to have meaning. 
> - [ ] Quantitative data are obtained from measurements, and are always associated with random errors/uncertainties, determined by the apparatus and by human limitations such as reaction time. 
> - [ ] Propagation of random errors in data processing shows the impact of the uncertainties on the final result. 
> - [ ] Experimental design, procedure and equipment can all lead to systematic errors in measurement, which cause a deviation in a particular direction. 
> - [ ] Random errors affect the precision of a measurement while systematic errors affect its accuracy. 
> - [ ] Repeat trials and measurements will reduce random errors but not systematic errors. 
### **Students will be able to…** 

- [ ] Convert within both metric and non-metric unit systems. 
- [ ] Record uncertainties in all measurements as a range (±) to an appropriate precision. 
- [ ] Distinguish between random and systematic errors. 
- [ ] Distinguish between accuracy and precision when evaluating results. 
- [ ] Propagate uncertainties in processed data, including the use of percentage uncertainties. 
### **Theory of Knowledge questions/connections:** 
- [ ] Scientists report uncertainties on a measurement to quantify its precision, but some non-scientists interpret these uncertainties as meaning “but we don’t really know”.** 
- [ ] Does the inclusion of an uncertainty make a measurement more or less clear?** 
- [ ] How do measurement uncertainties impact how scientific results are received by the public?*
- [ ] How can we improve communication and understanding with respect to scientific results and issues?

# Precision and accuracy

The quality of any given measurement can be described in terms of *accuracy* or *precision*. 
**Accuracy:**   The closeness of a measured value to a *standard* or *known value*.

Example:  The density of water (at 4ºC) is known to be **1.00 g/mL** 

| |**Single measurement** |**Set of three measurements**  |
|**“Accurate”** |- |➢  ➢ |
|**“Inaccurate”** |➢ ➢ |➢  ➢ |

**Precision:**   The *reproducibility* of multiple measurements, often described by an uncertainty (±)      
The number of significant figures (digits) reported also reflects a measurement’s precision.   
In a data set that includes multiple measurements, the spread or variability in the individual measurements (the *reproducibility*) is a reflection of the precision.* 


| |**Single measurement** |**Set of three measurements** |
| :- | - | - |
|**“Precise” or “Reproducible”** |➢ ➢ ➢ |<p> </p><p> </p><p>➢ </p>|
|**“Imprecise” or “Not reproducible”** |➢ ➢ ➢ |<p> </p><p>- ` `➢ </p>|

Note that the terms *accuracy* and *precision* are neither interchangeable nor mutually exclusive. They describe different properties of a measurement so it is possible to be both, neither, or one but not the other. 

Let’s illustrate this another way using a dartboard as an analogy, where the “bullseye” or centre of the dartboard corresponds to the *known* *value*. Draw four Xs (darts) on each dartboard below such that they correspond to the stated levels of precision and accuracy:

**Practice Problems on precision and accuracy:** 

1. An object of mass 2.000 kg is placed on four different balances and for each balance the reading, in units of kg, is recorded five times: 



|**Balance** |**1** |**2** |**3** |**4** |**5** |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
|A |2\.000 |2\.004 |1\.998 |2\.002 |2\.006 |

Rank each balance from *most precise* to *least precise* and *most accurate* to *least accurate***

5. What are some experimental factors that might limit the *accuracy* of a particular measurement?  
5. To what extent are the terms *precise* and *accurate* subject to the judgement of the experimenter?  Can you give an example of a situation where two experimenters might look at the same measurement(s) and disagree as to their precision or accuracy? 
5. What are the limitations of the “dartboard analogy” as a tool for better understanding the terms *precision* and *accuracy*? Can you think of other analogies you have learned in your science education (i.e. “Concept X is like a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_...”) that may also have limited applications? 
5. Obviously,** we use the terms *precise* and *accurate* in other contexts besides measurement.** Is there a difference between using precise *language* and using accurate *language*? Example, please.

Significant figures in measured values 

One of the central concepts of our first unit of study is that *every experimental measurement has some uncertainty or error associated with it*. In other words, all measurements are imprecise to some degree. 

Looking at the number of **significant figures** in a particular measured value is one way to understand just how uncertain or imprecise that measurement is. A **significant figure** (“sig fig”) can be defined as: 

- Digits in a measured value that carry *meaning*. 
- Digits in a measured value that were actually *measured*. 
- Digits in a measured value that reflect its *precision* rather than its magnitude (= place value). 
- Digits in a measured value that appear in the coefficient when expressed in *scientific notation*. 

These definitions can be a bit confusing, so let’s break things down to a few simple rules and try to understand this concept by exploring a few examples: 

**Rule #1:   All non-zero digits are significant.**      Example:  Mr. Furugori is 142 cm tall (3 s.f.) 

- All non-zero digits have been *measured* and thus carry meaning. 

**Rule #2:   Trailing zeros to the LEFT of a decimal place are not significant.** 

- These digits describe magnitude (place value), but are not measured digits. 
- These digits do not contribute to the *precision* of a measurement. 

Example:  “This rock is 500,000,000 years old” is the same as saying “this rock is 5×109 years old” 

The zeros were not *measured*; the meaning is clearly “approximately 500,000,000 years old”, not “exactly 500,000,000 years old to the nearest year”. 

As such, there is only one significant figure (measured digit) in this measurement: the “5” 

**Rule #3:  Zeros between significant figures are significant.** 

Example:  “This rock is 500,000,038 years old.” Now the measurement has 9 s.f., not just 1 s.f. Why? 

**Rule #4:  Trailing zeros to the RIGHT of a decimal place are significant.** 

Example:  Consider the following measurements:    2 kg   2.0 kg  2.00 kg  2.000 kg **Rule #5:  Zeros before a non-zero digit are not significant.** 

Example:  Sound travels from my mouth to your ears in 0.009 seconds (= 9×10-3 seconds) has only 1 s.f. **Rule #6:  In scientific notation, all digits are significant (not including “×10n”).** 

Compare these three representations of “five hundred metres”:      500m        5.0×102m      5.00×102 m 

(1 s.f)                  (2 s.f)            (3 s.f) 

**Rule #7:  “Counting” or “exact” numbers are treated like they are *perfectly* or *infinitely* precise.** 

Example: “12 eggs” means *exactly* twelve, and is treated as though it was written “12.0000000….” 

Exact values such as p, ½, and many unit conversion factors (e.g.1kg=1000g, 1inch = 2.54cm) are *perfectly precise* and are considered as having an “infinite” number of s.f. 

Measurement-**4** 

Calculations with Significant Figures 

When performing calculations with measured quantities, the precision of the final result is limited to the precision of the *least precise measurement*. 

As an example, consider someone trying to measure the area of a rectangular room. She measures the length very precisely: 6.9255 m (5 s.f.), but only makes a rough estimate for the width: 4 m (1 s.f.). 

She then calculates:   Area = *length × width* = 6.9255 m × 4 m = **27.702 m2**

However, since the width was only known to a precision of 1 s.f., the precision of the calculated area can only be known to 1 s.f. as well. 

The calculated area is thus most fairly expressed like so: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**RULE #1:**  When *multiplying* or *dividing*, round the final answer to the **same number of ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.005.png)**

**significant figures** as the least precise measurement used in the calculation. 

5\.00  ×  7.000  =      1280000     = (3 s.f.)          (4.s.f)       640 

`  `1200 × 0.0950     =   **0.01511335…**           754.3 

**RULE #2:**  When *adding* or *subtracting*, round the final answer to the **same place value** as        ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.006.png)

The SI Unit system and Unit Conversions 

Over time, people have used countless different unit systems to measure volume, mass, length, and other quantities. In 1960, the international community agreed on a common system of units for scientific communication, which they called the International System of Units (abbreviated the “SI system” from the French *Système Internationale d’Unités*). Six of the **base units** in the SI unit system are: 



|**Quantity** |**Written Unit** |**Unit Symbol** |
| - | - | - |
|Length |Metre |m |
|Mass |Kilogram |kg |
|Time |Second |s   |
|Amount of Substance |Mole |mol  |
|Temperature |Kelvin |K |
|Current |Ampere |A |

Base units can be scaled up or down by *orders of magnitude* (powers of 10) using metric prefixes: 



|**Name** |deca- |hecto- |kilo- |mega- |giga- |tera- |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|**Symbol** |da |h |k |M |G |T |
|**Factor** |<p>1 </p><p>10</p>|102 |103 |106 |109 |<p>12</p><p>10</p>|
|**Name** |deci- |centi- |milli- |micro- |nano- |pico- |
|**Symbol** |d |c |m |µ |n |p |
|**Factor** |<p>-1 </p><p>10</p>|<p>-2</p><p>10</p>|<p>-3</p><p>10</p>|<p>-6</p><p>10</p>|<p>-9</p><p>10</p>|<p>-12</p><p>10</p>|

For example, a very small sample of a substance weighing 0.00005 grams could have its mass more conveniently expressed in *milli*grams (mg) or *micro*grams (µg): 

0\.00005 g = 0.05×10-3 g = 0.05 mg                     0.00005 g = 50×10-6 g = 50 **μ**g 

Perhaps more intuitively, one could recognize that there are 1000 milligrams or 1000000 micrograms in one gram and simply multiply: 

0\.00005 g  ×  1000 = 0.05 mg                       0.00005 g  ×  1000000  = 50 **μ**g 

Somewhat less intuitively, you could use the fact that the ratios (1000 mg : 1 g) and (1000000 μg : 1 g) are both **equal to one**. We call these ratios *conversion factors* and since they are equal to one, multiplying or dividing by these ratios does not change the actual magnitude of a value, only its units: 

0\.00005 g  ×~~   10~~ 0~~ 0~~  mg~~    = 0.05 mg            0.00005 g  ×~~  100~~ 0~~ 0~~ 0~~ 0~~~~   μg~~~~     = 50 **μ**g 

1 g  1 g 

For conversions this simple, the last method (called the *factor-label* method or *dimensional analysis*) will seem like overkill, but it is very useful when handling more complex unit conversions (see next page).

Uncertainty 

No measurement is exact.** When a quantity is measured, the outcome depends on the measuring equipment, the measurement procedure, the skill of the operator, the environment, and other factors. 

Even if a quantity were to be measured several times, in the same way and under the same circumstances,  a different measured value would often be obtained each time. We call this **random error**. 

A **measurement uncertainty** is a number that characterizes the random error in a measured value. 

No measurement is complete without an appropriate uncertainty. ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.011.png)

An uncertainty is written after the measured value, but before the unit. Examples:    27 ± 1ºC  

0\.0108 ± 0.0002 g 

1800 ± 100 mL 

The last (significant) digit of any measured value is always uncertain. ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.012.png)

*Hence, an uncertainty is always reported to the same precision (place value) as its measurement*. Examples of incorrectly reported measurements:   12 ± 0.01 g  22.50 ± 0.5 mL  

When reading glassware or other pieces of *analog* equipment, the experimenter must make a reasonable judgment as to what the final digit and its uncertainty should be.  

Common practice is to set the uncertainty as one-half, one-fifth or one-tenth of the **smallest marked division** on the scale, depending on the spacing between the divisions. If divisions are well-spaced, often one-tenth is most appropriate. When markings are very close together, one-half may be more appropriate.

Measurement-**9** 

Now try some practice on your own. Remember, the magnitude of the uncertainty is a *judgement call* based on the size of the spacing between divisions or, in some cases, environmental factors too. 

The most common uncertainties are *one-half*, *one-fifth*, or *one-tenth* of the **smallest marked division**. Tips:   Determine magnitude of the **SMD** and the uncertainty *first*, then determine the measured value. 

Don’t forget to ensure that the **precision** of the measured value and the uncertainty agree.

Random and systematic error 

All experimental error is due to either **random error** or **systematic error**. 

- **Random errors** are caused by factors that vary unpredictably from one measurement to the next. 
  - Statistical fluctuations *in both directions* (larger and smaller) in the measured data 
  - Primarily due to the limitations of the measuring equipment; **expressed as an uncertainty**. 
- **Random errors limit the *precision* of a measurement.** How can we minimize random errors? 
- **Systematic errors** are reproducible inaccuracies that are *consistently in the same direction* (that is to say, they bias the measurement either up or down). They may occur because: 
  - An instrument is flawed or has not been calibrated correctly before use 
  - An instrument is being consistently incorrectly used by the experimenter 
  - There is a flaw in the procedure leading to a measurement being incorrect 
- **Systematic errors limit the *accuracy* of a measurement**, but are usually difficult to detect. ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.034.png)

Consider each statement and determine whether it is describing a *random* or a *systematic* error. If *random*, assess the magnitude of the error. If *systematic*, assess the magnitude and direction of the error.

1. A biologist studying the reproduction rate of a particular strain of bacteria makes multiple measurements but obtains very different results each time. 
1. As a joke, somebody drew a decimal place on the readout of your voltmeter between the “tens” place and the “ones” place (so that, for example, 57 V would actually be read as 5.7 V. Hilarious.) 
1. Vibrations from a nearby centrifuge are affecting the stability of a buret making it difficult for a student to read the wobbly meniscus, so she assigns an uncertainty of ±0.1 mL instead of ±0.05 mL.

Propagating uncertainties in calculated results 

When you perform calculations using measured values and their uncertainties, you must carry the uncertainties over (*propagate* them) to the calculated value. This ensures that the random errors inherent in the original measured values are appropriately expressed in the new, calculated value. 

Definitions: 

**Absolute uncertainty:*** Simply the *magnitude* (value) of the measurement uncertainty  

Example:  10.00 ± 0.05 mL 

**Relative uncertainty:***   The percentage (or decimal) uncertainty  

**Uncertainty propagation for *addition* and *subtraction*:** Example 1:  (12 ± 2 cm)  +  (25 ± 5 cm)  =  

**When adding and subtracting, *add the absolute uncertainties*. ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.035.png)**Example 2:  (45 ± 1) mL  –  (20.0 ± 0.7) mL   =  

RECALL: ✓  Uncertainties are only reported to only 1 s.f. 

✓  The **precision** of the measured value and uncertainty must *agree to the same place value.* 

**Uncertainty propagation for *multiplication* and *division*:** 

**When multiplying and dividing, *add the relative (percentage) uncertainties*. ![](Aspose.Words.875f4e8a-78b4-4b5a-ad8c-ea85ad6208d1.036.png)**Example 3:    0.70 ± 0.05 m  **×**  22 ± 1 m   **Step 1:  Always get the correct answer first!** 

0\.70 m × 22 m  =  15.4 m2

**Step 2:   Add the percentage uncertainties:** 

0\.05/0.70 = 0.071, or 7.1% 1 / 22  =  0.045, or 4.5% 

Example 4:       4750 ± 50 mm3    **Step 1:  Always get the correct answer first!** 

`                             `37 ± 1 mm   4750 mm3 / 37 mm  =  128.378 mm2 **Step 2:   Add the percentage uncertainties:** 

50/4750 = 0.011, or 1.1% 1 / 37  =  0.027, or 2.7% 

Measurement-**12** 

When scaling a measurement up or down (i.e. multiplying or dividing) by a *constant*, the relative uncertainty does not change, but the absolute uncertainty does: 

Example 5:   If the mass of one marble, *m*, is 2.50 ± 0.05 cm… 

Then the mass of twelve marbles, 12*m* = 12(2.50 ± 0.05 cm) = 30.0 ± 0.6 cm 

Let’s try some mixed examples now. Follow the same principles we just discussed, only apply the rules for order of operations (“BEDMAS” rules) for the measurements *and their uncertainties*.

4) D  =  x2 + xy  e)  E  =  x/z  +  y/x  f)  F =  (x + y)(y – 10z) 
2. A student measures the initial volume of alcohol in a petri dish to be 17.5 ± 0.5 mL. After 64± 2min passes during which time some of the alcohol evaporates; the final volume is measured to be 8.4 ± 0.2 mL. Determine how much alcohol evaporated, with an appropriate uncertainty. Determine the rate that the alcohol evaporated, in mL/s, with an appropriate uncertainty.

2. How many litres of water can a cubic container with a side length of 8.00 ± 0.02 inches hold? 
2. A particularly bored student, instead of listening during class, watched an ant crawl the length of her ruler (30.0 ± 0.1 cm) in 12.0 ± 0.5 seconds. How fast was the ant crawling, in km/h? 
2. If there are 235 ± 5 students in the IB program this year (the way you people scurry around the halls so fast it makes you hard to count, hence the uncertainty) and each one will do 120 ± 20 minutes of homework every weeknight, how much collective homework will be done this school year by IB students?

c)  13.92 ± 0.02 mL or 13.90 ± 0.05 mL  d)  SMD/5:  8.6 or 8.7 ± 0.1 mL, or SMD/2:  8.8 ± 0.3 mL 

5) 270 ± 10 mL is a good measurement here; reading more precisely could yield ±5, ±4, or ±2 mL instead. 
5. a) Your measurement should have a *small relative uncertainty* (and hence *many* *significant figures*), but not be close to the accepted value. For example, something like 0.07654±0.00002 m/s. 

b) Your measurement should have a *large relative uncertainty* (and hence *few significant figures*), but be very close to the accepted value. For example, something like (3±2)×108 m/s or (3.0±0.9)×108 m/s. 

6. a) Your measurements should have small relative uncertainties and be closely clustered together (i.e. highly reproducible), but not be close to the accepted value. For example: 0.99±0.01 g/cm3, 1.00±0.01 g/cm3, 1.01±0.01 g/cm3 (maybe this person confused water for iron ☺)
7) Your measurements should have large relative uncertainties and vary significantly from one to the other (i.e. not be reproducible), but the average of the measurements should be close to the accepted value. This one is a little more difficult to craft a realistic example for, but consider something like: 1.0±0.5 g/cm3, 2.5±0.5 g/cm3, 20±10 g/cm3 (compute this average to convince yourself that this set is *accurate*, in a sense)
8) Pretty straight-forward here. Just like (a) but close to the accepted value. Something like 7.873±0.001 g/cm3, 7.874±0.001 g/cm3, 7.875±0.001 g/cm3 works nicely. 
9. a)  8000 ± 2000 cm3   b)  27 ± 6 cm   c)  320 ± 40 cm   d)  4.7 ± 0.8 cm 8 ± 1 

   5) 9 ± 1   f)   8 ± 1  g)  0.08 ± 0.01   Question: Why are the answers to e, f and g *unitless*? 
10. 130 ± 10 L  
11. $0.38 ± 0.04… but you can bet they charge a lot more than that in the store! ☺ 
12. a) 1.0±0.2 km2/h (rounded from 0.96±0.16 km2/h)  b) 3.1 ± 0.4 km2/h  c) 3.6 ± 0.3 km2/h 
13. The best example of *random error* is the built-in limitation in the glassware itself, i.e. the ±0.05 mL uncertainty of the buret. Note that this is actually a very small amount of random error; burets are among our most precise pieces of glassware and have very small relative uncertainties. A beaker, for example, introduces a lot more random error into measurements (as we clearly saw during Part A of the Coke lab). You could have also discuss things like temperature fluctuations or shaky tables, but they are weaker examples.  
A great example of *systematic error* is someone who doesn’t eject the air bubble from the buret tip before dispensing the 25.00 mL. This would introduce a negative bias into their measurement since they will be dispensing less than 25.00 mL of liquid each time (the first mL or so will be air!). Another example is dispensing from too great a height so that some liquid splashes out of the beaker (also a negative bias). Note that something like consistently reading the buret from below eye-level is not a systematic error. Why not?  

12. What a great question! So great, in fact, that I think I’ll add something very similar to it on your test! 

In summary, remember that there are two primary ways that a measurement can be precise. Precise *single measurements* have small uncertainties and hence many significant figures. Precise *data sets* (i.e. repeated measurements/trials) are highly reproducible (there is little variability from one trial to the next).  

Being accurate is less nuanced: simply make a measurement that is “correct” (close to the accepted/known value).  

Final piece of advice: On our Unit Test…make sure your calculations are *accurate*, and your language is *precise*. ☺
