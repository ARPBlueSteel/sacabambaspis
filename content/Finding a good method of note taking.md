# Getting Started
Taking notes, or otherwise collecting information during your classes is a important part of the daily life of an IB student and a student in general. Therefore, it is important that students be able to find a method of note taking they find comfortable. Personally, I believe that a note taking method should fit the way a person thinks and not vice versa. Notes are, in essence, a second brain we bring along with us. Therefore, this second brain should mimic the structure of your thoughts as best as possible.
## So, What do You Take Notes For?
It is important to understand what are your purposes of taking notes before selecting a method or app. This is important as some applications/methods might not be suitable for some purposes.

**Some purposes of taking notes may be:**
- To record information during a class
- To organize information in a logical manner
- To help recall concepts and assist in memorization

Also, keep in mind what classes you will be taking when developing a note taking routine. For example, a student who takes typed notes during a class with Mr. Peters might struggle due to the difficulties in typing math (**I beg, I beg, do not use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to take notes during math class**). Teachers from RHS present information in different ways and in some cases you might not need to take notes for certain courses. 

**In general:**
- English and Language courses require minimal note taking except for formats and grammar. In many cases the teacher will give a handout.
- History is mostly text based
- Math tends to require custom symbols and diagrams
- Biology is mostly text based with the occasional diagram

## How do you organize information?
