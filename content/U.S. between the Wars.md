### End of the Depression (and the hidden costs)!

Roosevelt's New Deal did not end the Great Depression

World War II DID!

would it have been possible to have tackled America's economic problems without increaisng the power of the government?

Did Roosevelt betray democracy and "liberty" of the Americans by his New Deal?


### In review

1. The USSR and USA both faced major economic problems in the late 1920s and 1930s. Compare and contrast the manner in which respective leaders addressed these problems.
2. Explain how the industrial and economic "gap" closed between the USSR & USA by the late 1930s.
3. Was it inevitable that the USA and uSSR would rise to the status of super powers (world leaders)?
