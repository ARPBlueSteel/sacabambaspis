# Notes
## Part 1

### Ear!y Civiizations
When Europeans first arrived the in the new world or North America, there were approximately 2 million native people, ranging from the Inuit of Northern Canada to the Apache in Southwest United States. They spoke hundreds of languages. Prior to these Indian groups, civilizations had come and gone, such as the Pueblo Bonito civilizations of New Mexico and the Mesa Verde civilization (Anasazi Indians) Of Colorado. of these civilizations left us with many mysteries such as Poverty Point in Louisiana (similar to Stonehenge) and the Mound Builders structures near St. Louis, Missouri.

In Central America. the area from Mexico City through Nicaragua was called Mesoamerica. It was home to 25 million The Olmec people. who lived along the Gulf of Mexico from about 12W.4(X) BC, developed advanced cities, a crude writing system. and a game like This was about 150 years before King Tut in Egypt. There were also further advanced civilizations that required a sedentary population who developed agriculture as well as items like basket weaving and The first city developed was in Central Mexico called Teotihuacan in 500 BC This was a city of approximately people, the same size as Imperial Rome, Although the city would eventually die, other great cultures arose like the Monte Alban civilization in southwest Mexico and the great Mayan cities of Tikal, Tulum, and Chichen Ttza in the area from Guatemala to the Yucatan. Other great cities would develop, such as Tenochtitlan (Mexico city), with the development of the Aztec civilizations. In South America, prior to the Inca, it would Mochica and Nazca (Nazca Lines) of Peru and Bolivia. By the year AD, almost five hundred years before Christopher Columbus, many of these great civilizations died leaving us with many mysteries, including the reason for their decline and death in some regions.

## Part 2

### Arrival of the Europeans

During the 15th century, the European powers began to explore west across the Atlantic.

There were a number of reasons for this exploration:

1. In the Middle East, the Muslim Turks had taken Constantinople in 1453 and cut off trade with the Orients.
2. European powers objected to the trade monopoly held by Italy and sought other trade routes west to other parts of the world that bypassed the Italians,
3. Technology had caught up with the urge to explore around the world. For example: Astrolabe — used to determine latitude and longitude and the Caravel a 3 masted boat that could sail into the wind or go in any direction.
4. The Age of Exploration was led by countries like Portugal, Spain, and then Britain. These countries hired out-of-work sea captains from Italy to explore the West. (Italian navigation needed work at this time.) (Chinese explorer Zheng He was in North America (Newfoundland) 70 years before Columbus)
5. One of the goals of exploration west was Europe's desire for gold and silver as well as the base for the European economic system called 'mercantilism".

### Arrival of the Spanish

It was "God, Glory and Gold" that drove the Spanish. This was the slogan for God was for the purpose of religious conversion, or the true religion, the Roman Catholic Church. The Church considered the Natives of North and South America to pagans or heathens and a people without a religion. These souls had to be saved. As a result, missionaries flooded into the New world with the explorers. They spread Christianity as well as the Empire. Glory was for the purpose of prestige and building an empire. It brought with it political influence in Europe. Gold was important to accumulate and you could get it in 2 ways: by trade or by taking it. Gold within the Spanish Empire was based on mercantilism and colonialism (building of colonies). At this point in history wealth was measured on how much gold could accumulated. For the Spanish, it meant finding "EI Dorado".

### Why did the Spanish so easily defeat the native people} (Aztecs. Incas)?

> [!summary] Reasons:
> 1. The native people were isolated, therefore very naïve and innocent of Europeans. The natives assumed they were the only human beings and hence, did not think Europeans were from the same world.
> 2. The natives thought the Europeans were Gods. For example, Cortez arrived in 1519, the same year in Aztec mythology that the god Quetzalcoatl (creator of the Sun) would return.
> 3. European technology was superior to the natives such as spears, long poles, guns. armor, and horses.
> 4. The early explorers and Conquistadors had Christianity on their side. This made them self-confident and secure in what they were doing, as they thought they were doing the work of God.
> 5. European diseases like smallpox and cholera were responsible for killing over of the native people.
> 6. Groups like the Aztec and Incas had over the years made many enemies. Cortez would ally himself with the enemies of the Aztecs like the Tobaskans and Tlaxcallans to defeat the Aztec.

• The conquistadors era was very brief and very bloody.

## The Roman Catholic Church

>[!question]
>To what extent was the Roman Catholic Church was an omnipotent institution in New Spain (meaning all powerful)?

By the 15th century in Europe the church and state had separated (Pope Gregory VII in 1073 separation of Church and State). This was not the case in the Spanish Empire. The church and state were one. and the role of the Church was to aid in the building of an empire. This meant that the Church was to civilize and Christianize the native population. This led to the growth and of the Church and in turn, led to a conflict with the state.

## Law of Burgos 1512-1513
The Spanish King (Ferdinand) realized the relationship between the Spanish explorers and the Native Indians of Latin America needed to be improved. He was horrified that the Indians were treated as non-equals and had turned into slaves. This law dealt with the Spanish-Indian relatives and their King Ferdinand wanted the Indians treated as equals, or like monarchs from other European countries. Indians were not to be used as slaves. The law was to administered by the Friars, The law, however, was not enforced well enough and the Indians continued to treated like slaves.

New Laws of the Indies 1542 - This law prohibited the enslavement of Indians. It even went further and freed all Indian slaves where they could not establish legal title, They even abolished service contracts (like Black Codes), as well as regulate tribute and trade Indians and whites. In theory, these laws should have protected the Indians, but they did not. One of the biggest abusers was the Roman Catholic Church.

## Influence of the Roman Catholic Church
Effects:
1) The Church and State were one or equal partners in the building of an empire. The Jesuits were effective empire builders, thus "Glory. Gold, and God".
2) One of the purposes of the Church was to civilize the Indian into the European culture. In doing so, Indian culture and independence was destroyed, lending itself to genocide.
3) The next objective of the Church was the Christianization of Indians. The means of doing this was the building of missions from the tip of Argentina to California. As a result, Indians became slaves to the mission and the building of the Roman Catholic Churches.
4) The Church imgx»sed a paternalistic structure on society as well as within the Church. The purpose was to bring order to society, from the top down, and with men at the top.
5) The Roman Catholic Church and the Jesuit Order became very wealthy. With wealth comes power and with power comes corruption. The Church and the Jesuit Order not only challenged the King of Spain (Charles III) but the authority of the As a result, the Ling had little choice and in 1767 the Jesuits were expelled from New Spain. The King regained control.

>"Power corrupts and absolute corrupts absolutely."

## Conclusion
In New Spain, the Roman Catholic Church became a very important and omniSX)tent institution in the
process of building an empire and as an integral part of the empire.
